abstract = {It is well-known that if we gauge a ℤn symmetry in two dimensions, a dual ℤn symmetry appears, such that re-gauging this dual ℤn symmetry leads back to the original theory. We describe how this can be generalized to non-Abelian groups, by enlarging the concept of symmetries from those defined by groups to those defined by unitary fusion categories. We will see that this generalization is also useful when studying what happens when a non-anomalous subgroup of an anomalous finite group is gauged: for example, the gauged theory can have non-Abelian group symmetry even when the original symmetry is an Abelian group. We then discuss the axiomatization of two-dimensional topological quantum field theories whose symmetry is given by a category. We see explicitly that the gauged version is a topological quantum field theory with a new symmetry given by a dual category.},

The book contains explanations and descriptions of many details that have been deliberately (and, I suspect, at times inadvertently) swept under a very large rug in these lectures. Volume two covers the superstring. • M. Green, J. Schwarz and E. Witten, Superstring Theory Another two volume set. It is now over 20 years old and takes a slightly old-fashioned route through the subject, with no explicit mention of conformal field theory. How-ever, it does contain much good material and the explanations are uniformly excellent. Volume one is most relevant for these lectures. • B. Zwiebach, A First Course in String Theory This book grew out of a course given to undergraduates who had no previous exposure to general relativity or quantum field theory. It has wonderful pedagogical discussions of the basics of lightcone quantization. More surprisingly, it also has some very clear descriptions of several advanced topics, even though it misses out all the bits in between.},

abstract = {In this thesis we develop an orbifold theory for a finite, cyclic group $G$ acting on a suitably regular, holomorphic vertex operator algebra $V$. To this end we describe the fusion algebra of the fixed-point vertex operator subalgebra $V^G$ and show that $V^G$ has group-like fusion. Then we solve the extension problem for vertex operator algebras with group-like fusion. We use these results to construct five new holomorphic vertex operator algebras of central charge 24 as lattice orbifolds, contributing to the classification of the $V_1$-structures of suitably regular, holomorphic vertex operator algebras of central charge 24. As another application we present the BRST construction of ten Borcherds-Kac-Moody algebras whose denominator identities are completely reflective automorphic products of singular weight.},

The chiral fermion parity of the free fermion implies that the Monster CFT is self-dual under the $\mathbb{Z}_{2A}$ orbifold, i.e. it enjoys the Kramers-Wannier duality. The Kramers-Wannier duality defect extends the Monster group to a larger category of topological defect lines that contains an Ising subcategory. We introduce the defect McKay-Thompson series defined as the Monster partition function twisted by the duality defect, and find that the coefficients can be decomposed into the dimensions of the (projective) irreducible representations of the Baby Monster group. We further prove that the defect McKay-Thompson series is invariant under the genus-zero congruence subgroup $16D^0$ of $PSL(2,\mathbb{Z})$.},

For every abelian group of odd order the Drinfel'd centers of the associated Tambara-Yamagami categories give a fusion ring generalizing the Verlinde ring $\mathrm{Spin}(2n+1)_2$ in the case of $\mathbb{Z}_{2n+1}$. We classify all generalized metaplectic modular categories, i.e. unitary modular tensor category with those fusion rules and show that they are realized as $\mathbb{Z}_2$-orbifolds of conformal nets associated with lattices. We further show that twisted doubles of generalized dihedral groups of abelian groups of odd order are group-theoretical generalized metaplectic modular categories and vice versa. We give some examples of twisted orbifolds of conformal nets and show how generalized metaplectic modular categories arise by condensation of simpler ones.},

abstract = {We relate two classical dualities in low-dimensional quantum field theory: Kramers-Wannier duality of the Ising and related lattice models in $2$ dimensions, with electromagnetic duality for finite gauge theories in $3$ dimensions. The relation is mediated by the notion of boundary field theory: Ising models are boundary theories for pure gauge theory in one dimension higher. Thus the Ising order/disorder operators are endpoints of Wilson/'t Hooft defects of gauge theory. Symmetry breaking on low-energy states reflects the multiplicity of topological boundary states. In the process we describe lattice theories as (extended) topological field theories with boundaries and domain walls. This allows us to generalize the duality to non-abelian groups; finite, semi-simple Hopf algebras; and, in a different direction, to finite homotopy theories in arbitrary dimension.},

We study the crossing relations of TDLs, discuss their relation to the 't Hooft anomaly, and use them to constrain renormalization group flows to either conformal critical points or topological quantum field theories (TQFTs). We show that if certain non-invertible TDLs are preserved along a RG flow, then the vacuum cannot be a non-degenerate gapped state. For various massive flows, we determine the infrared TQFTs completely from the consideration of TDLs together with modular invariance.},

abstract = {While many scientists are familiar with fractals, fewer are familiar with scale-invariance and universality which underly the ubiquity of their shapes. These properties may emerge from the collective behaviour of simple fundamental constituents, and are studied using statistical field theories. Initial chapters connect the particulate perspective developed in the companion volume, to the coarse grained statistical fields studied here. Based on lectures taught by Professor Kardar at MIT, this textbook demonstrates how such theories are formulated and studied. Perturbation theory, exact solutions, renormalization groups, and other tools are employed to demonstrate the emergence of scale invariance and universality, and the non-equilibrium dynamics of interfaces and directed paths in random media are discussed. Ideal for advanced graduate courses in statistical physics, it contains an integrated set of problems, with solutions to selected problems at the end of the book and a complete set available to lecturers at www.cambridge.org/9780521873413.},

It is shown that whenever there is a topological order in bulk, characterized by a nonvanishing Chern number, even if it is defined for a nonconserved quantity such as spin in the case of the spin Hall effect, one can always infer the existence of gapless edge states under certain twisted boundary conditions that allow tunneling between edges. This relation is robust against disorder and interactions, and it provides a unified topological classification of both the quantum (charge) Hall effect and the quantum spin Hall effect. In addition, it reconciles the apparent conflict between the stability of bulk topological order and the instability of gapless edge states in systems with open boundaries (a known happening in the spin Hall case). The consequences of time reversal invariance for bulk topological order and edge state dynamics are further studied in the present framework. {\textcopyright} 2006 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {We give a comprehensive review of various methods to define currents and the energy-momentum tensor in classical field theory, with emphasis on a geometric point of view. The necessity of "improving" the expressions provided by the canonical Noether procedure is addressed and given an adequate geometric framework. The main new ingredient is the explicit formulation of a principle of "ultralocality" with respect to the symmetry generators, which is shown to fix the ambiguity inherent in the procedure of improvement and guide it towards a unique answer: when combined with the appropriate splitting of the fields into sectors, it leads to the well-known expressions for the current as the variational derivative of the matter field Lagrangian with respect to the gauge field and for the energy-momentum tensor as the variational derivative of the matter field Lagrangian with respect to the metric tensor. In the second case, the procedure is shown to work even when the matter field Lagrangian depends explicitly on the curvature, thus establishing the correct relation between scale invariance, in the form of local Weyl invariance "on shell", and tracelessness of the energy-momentum tensor, required for a consistent definition of the concept of a conformal field theory. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Differential geometry and topology have become essential tools for many theoretical physicists. In particular, they are indispensable in theoretical studies of condensed matter physics, gravity, and particle physics. Geometry, Topology and Physics, Second Edition introduces the ideas and techniques of differential geometry and topology at a level suitable for postgraduate students and researchers in these fields. The second edition of this popular and established text incorporates a number of changes designed to meet the needs of the reader and reflect the development of the subject. The book features a considerably expanded first chapter, reviewing aspects of path integral quantization and gauge theories. Chapter 2 introduces the mathematical concepts of maps, vector spaces, and topology. The following chapters focus on more elaborate concepts in geometry and topology and discuss the application of these concepts to liquid crystals, superfluid helium, general relativity, and bosonic string theory. Later chapters unify geometry and topology, exploring fiber bundles, characteristic classes, and index theorems. New to this second edition is the proof of the index theorem in terms of supersymmetric quantum mechanics. The final two chapters are devoted to the most fascinating applications of geometry and topology in contemporary physics, namely the study of anomalies in gauge field theories and the analysis of Polakov's bosonic string theory from the geometrical point of view. Geometry, Topology and Physics, Second Edition is an ideal introduction to differential geometry and topology for postgraduate students and researchers in theoretical and mathematical physics.},

Rather, it is intended to lay a conceptual foundation by which magnetic resonance image formation can be understood from an intuitive perspective. The presentation is nonmathematical, relying on simple models that take the reader progressively from the basic spin physics of nuclei, through descriptions of how the magnetic resonance signal is generated and detected in an MRI scanner, the foundations of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation, and a discussion of the Fourier transform and its relation to MR image formation. The article continues with a discussion of how magnetic field gradients are used to facilitate spatial encoding and concludes with a development of basic pulse sequences and the factors defining image contrast.},

The crucial technical ingredient is a proof that the renormalized time-ordered product is equivalent to the pointwise product of classical field theory. The renormalized Batalin-Vilkovisky algebra is then the classical algebra but written in terms of the time-ordered product, together with an operator which replaces the ill defined graded Laplacian of the unrenormalized theory. We identify it with the anomaly term of the anomalous Master Ward Identity of Brennecke and D\"utsch. Contrary to other approaches we do not refer to the path integral formalism and do not need to use regularizations in intermediate steps.},

abstract = {It is shown that there are significant conceptual differences between QM and QFT which make it difficult to view the latter as just a relativistic extension of the principles of QM. At the root of this is a fundamental distiction between Born-localization in QM (which in the relativistic context changes its name to Newton-Wigner localization) and modular localization which is the localization underlying QFT, after one separates it from its standard presentation in terms of field coordinates. The first comes with a probability notion and projection operators, whereas the latter describes causal propagation in QFT and leads to thermal aspects of locally reduced finite energy states. The Born-Newton-Wigner localization in QFT is only applicable asymptotically and the covariant correlation between asymptotic in and out localization projectors is the basis of the existence of an invariant scattering matrix.In this first part of a two part essay the modular localization (the intrinsic content of field localization) and its philosophical consequences take the center stage. Important physical consequences of vacuum polarization will be the main topic of part II. The present division into two semi-autonomous essays is the result of a partition and extension of an originally one-part manuscript. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The Atiyah-Sutcliffe normalized determinant function $D$ is a smooth complex-valued function on $C_n(H^3)$, where $C_n(H^3)$ denotes the configuration space of $n$ distinct points in hyperbolic $3$-space $H^3$. The hyperbolic version of the Atiyah-Sutcliffe conjecture $1$ (AS conjecture $1$) states that $D$ is nowhere vanishing. AS conjecture $2$ (hyperbolic version) is the stronger statement that $|D(\mathbf{x})| \geq 1$ for any $\mathbf{x} \in C_n(H^3)$. In this short article, we prove AS conjecture $2$ for hyperbolic convex coplanar quadrilaterals, that is for configurations of $4$ points in $H^2$ with none of the points in the configuration lying in the convex hull of the other three. We also obtain Y. Zhang and J. Ma's result, namely AS conjecture $1$ for non-convex quadrilaterals in $H^2$. Finally, we find an explicit lower bound for $|D|$ depending on $n$ only for the natural ``star-based'' variant of the AS problem, for convex coplanar hyperbolic configurations. The latter result holds for any $n \geq 2$. The proofs for $n=4$ make use of the symbolic library of Python. The proof of the general result follows from a general formula for the determinant. In all these cases, $D$ can be expanded as a linear combination of non-negative rational functions with positive coefficients.},

abstract = {Characterizing how entanglement grows with time in a many-body system, for example, after a quantum quench, is a key problem in nonequilibrium quantum physics. We study this problem for the case of random unitary dynamics, representing either Hamiltonian evolution with time-dependent noise or evolution by a random quantum circuit. Our results reveal a universal structure behind noisy entanglement growth, and also provide simple new heuristics for the “entanglement tsunami” in Hamiltonian systems without noise. In 1D, we show that noise causes the entanglement entropy across a cut to grow according to the celebrated Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation. The mean entanglement grows linearly in time, while fluctuations grow like ðtimeÞ1=3 and are spatially correlated over a distance ∝ ðtimeÞ2=3. We derive KPZ universal behavior in three complementary ways, by mapping random entanglement growth to (i) a stochastic model of a growing surface, (ii) a “minimal cut” picture, reminiscent of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula in holography, and (iii) a hydrodynamic problem involving the dynamical spreading of operators. We demonstrate KPZ universality in 1D numerically using simulations of random unitary circuits. Importantly, the leading-order time dependence of the entropy is deterministic even in the presence of noise, allowing us to propose a simple coarse grained minimal cut picture for the entanglement growth of generic Hamiltonians, even without noise, in arbitrary dimensionality. We clarify the meaning of the “velocity” of entanglement growth in the 1D entanglement tsunami. We show that in higher dimensions, noisy entanglement evolution maps to the well-studied problem of pinning of a membrane or domain wall by disorder.},

The asymptotic symmetries of $AdS_2$ are all the time reparametrizations of the boundary. These symmetries are spontaneously broken by the $AdS_2$ geometry and they are explicitly broken by the small deformation away from $AdS_2$. This pattern of spontaneous plus explicit symmetry breaking governs the gravitational backreaction of the system. It determines several gravitational properties such as the linear in temperature dependence of the near extremal entropy as well as the gravitational corrections to correlation functions. These corrections include the ones determining the growth of out of time order correlators that is indicative of chaos. These gravitational aspects can be described in terms of a Schwarzian derivative effective action for a reparametrization.},

@article{Balachandran2016,
abstract = {In nonrelatistic quantum mechanics, Born's principle of localistion is as follows: For a single particle, if a wave function $\psi_K$ vanishes outside a spatial region $K$, it is said to be localised in $K$. In particular if a spatial region $K'$ is disjoint from $K$, a wave function $\psi_{K'}$ localised in $K'$ is orthogonal to $\psi_K$. Such a principle of localisation does not exist compatibly with relativity and causality in quantum field theory (Newton and Wigner) or interacting point particles (Currie,Jordan and Sudarshan).It is replaced by symplectic localisation of observables as shown by Brunetti, Guido and Longo, Schroer and others. This localisation gives a simple derivation of the spin-statistics theorem and the Unruh effect, and shows how to construct quantum fields for anyons and for massless particles with `continuous' spin. This review outlines the basic principles underlying symplectic localisation and shows or mentions its deep implications. In particular, it has the potential to affect relativistic quantum information theory and black hole physics.},

A gauge group of the first kind is shown to be automatically compact if the scattering states are complete and the mass and spin multiplets have finite multiplicity. Under reasonable assumptions about the structure of F it is shown that the inequivalent irreducible representations of A ("sectors") which occur are in one-to-one correspondence with the inequivalent irreducible representations of G and that all of them are "strongly locally equivalent". An irreducible representation of A satisfies the duality property only if the sector corresponds to a 1-dimensional representation of G. If G is Abelian the sectors are connected to each other by localized automorphisms.},

@article{Mizera2019,
abstract = {We elaborate on the recent proposal that intersection numbers of certain cohomology classes on the moduli space of genus-zero Riemann surfaces with punctures compute tree-level scattering amplitudes in quantum field theories. The relevant cohomology classes are twisted by representations of the fundamental group that describes how punctures braid around each other on the Riemann surface, which can be used to link it to the space of kinematic invariants. Intersection numbers of said cohomology classes, whose representatives we call twisted forms, can be shown to fully localize on the boundaries of the moduli space, which are in one-to-one map with Feynman diagrams. We prove that when twisted forms are logarithmic, their intersection numbers have a simple expansion in terms of trivalent Feynman diagrams allowing only for massless propagators on the internal and external lines. For physical applications one also needs to study non-logarithmic forms as they are responsible for propagation of massive states. We utilize the natural fibre bundle structure of the moduli space, which allows for a direct access to the boundaries, to introduce recursion relations for intersection numbers that "integrate out" puncture-by-puncture. The resulting recursion involves only linear algebra of certain matrices describing braiding properties of the moduli space and evaluating one-dimensional residues, thus paving a way for explicit analytic computations of scattering amplitudes. Together with the previous reformulation of the tree-level S-matrix of string theory in terms of twisted forms, the results of this work complete a unified geometric framework for studying scattering amplitudes from genus-zero Riemann surfaces. We show that a web of dualities between different homology and cohomology groups allows for deriving a host of identities among various types of amplitudes computed from the moduli space.},

abstract = {This book offers an elementary and unified introduction to the non-perturbative results obtained in relativistic quantum field theory based on classical soliton and instanton solutions. Such solutions are derived for a variety of models and classified by topological indices. The methods are then developed for quantizing solitons to obtain quantum particles. Vacuum tunneling, &ugr;-vacua and the dilute-instanton-gas approximation are described in detail. Other instanton effects related to quark-quark forces, confinement, the U(1) problem and Borel summability are also discussed. The emphasis is on presenting the basic ideas in a simple pedagogical way. Technical tools like functional methods, Grassman integrals, homotopy classification, collective co-ordinates etc. are developed ab initio. The presentation of this work is kept at a fairly simple level and ideas are developed through illustrative examples. Techniques not covered in older field theory textbooks, such as functional integral methods, are presented in some detail to the necessary extent. These techniques are important in their own right. Although the book is mainly addressed to particle physicists and quantum field theorists, several portions will be of relevance to other branches of physics, particularly statistical mechanics. These include three chapters devoted to deriving classical soliton and instanton solutions and one on collective co-ordinates, as well as sections devoted to general techniques.},

We make full use of invariance up to a divergence, or, as we call it here, Bessel-Hagen (BH) invariance. By recognizing that the Bessel-Hagen (BH) function need not be a total time derivative, we can easily deduce nonlocal constants of motion. We prove that we can always trivialize either the time change or the BH-function, so that, in particular, BH-invariance turns out not to be more general than Noether's original invariance. We also propose a version of time change that simplifies some key formulas. Applications include Lane-Emden equation, dissipative systems, homogeneous potentials and superintegrable systems. Most notably, we give two derivations of the Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector for Kepler's problem that require space and time change only, without BH invariance, one with and one without use of the Lagrange equation.},

abstract = {It is shown that two quantum theories dealing, respectively, in the Hilbert spaces of state vectors H1 and H2 are physically equivalent whenever we have a faithful representation of the same abstract algebra of observables in both spaces, no matter whether the representations are unitarily equivalent or not. This allows a purely algebraic formulation of the theory. The framework of an algebraic version of quantum field theory is discussed and compared to the customary operator approach. It is pointed out that one reason (and possibly the only one) for the existence of unitarily inequivalent faithful, irreducible representations in quantum field theory is the (physically irrelevant) behavior of the states with respect to observations made infinitely far away. The separation between such ``global&apos;&apos; features and the local ones is studied. An application of this point of view to superselection rules shows that, for example, in electrodynamics the Hilbert space of states with charge zero carries already all the relevant physical information.},

These are in general different. Therefore one reaches the remarkable possibility that there may be many entropies for a given state [Private communication from R. Sorkin]. This ambiguity in entropy can often be traced to a gauge symmetry emergent from the non-trivial topological character of the configuration space of the underlying system. It can also happen in finite-dimensional matrix models. In the present work, we discuss this entropy ambiguity and its consequences for an ethylene molecule. This is a very simple and well-known system where these notions can be put to tests. Besides its intrinsic conceptual interest, the simplicity of this model can serve as an introduction to a similar discussion of systems such as coloured monopoles and the breaking of colour symmetry.},

This determines an expansion of the metric in powers of proper distance normal to the geodesic, of which the second-order terms are explicitly computed here in terms of the curvature tensor at the corresponding point on the base geodesic. These terms determine the lowest-order effects of a gravitational field which can be measured locally by a freely falling observer. An example is provided in the Schwarz schild metric. This dis-cussion of Fermi Normal Coordinate provides numerous examples of the use of the modern, co-ordinate-free concept of a vector and of computations which are simplified by introducing a vector instead of its components. The ideas of contravariant vector and Lie Bracket, as well as the equation of geodesic deviation, are reviewed before being applied.},

abstract = {We review the BV formalism in the context of 0-dimensional gauge theories. For a gauge theory (X0,S0) with an affine configuration space X0, we describe an algorithm to construct a corresponding extended theory (X,S), obtained by introducing ghost and anti-ghost fields, with S a solution of the classical master equation in X. This construction is the first step to define the (gauge-fixed) BRST cohomology complex associated to (X,S), which encodes many interesting information on the initial gauge theory (X0,S0). The second part of this article is devoted to the application of this method to a matrix model endowed with a U(2)-gauge symmetry, explicitly determining the corresponding X and the general solution S of the classical master equation for the model.},

As an application, we obtain an $SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$-compatibility between twisted twining characters for commuting finite order automorphisms of holomorphic vertex operator algebras.

abstract = {These lectures are intended as an introduction to the technique of path integrals and their applications in physics. The audience is mainly first-year graduate students, and it is assumed that the reader has a good foundation in quantum mechanics. No prior exposure to path integrals is assumed, however. The path integral is a formulation of quantum mechanics equivalent to the standard formulations, offering a new way of looking at the subject which is, arguably, more intuitive than the usual approaches. Applications of path integrals are as vast as those of quantum mechanics itself, including the quantum mechanics of a single particle, statistical mechanics, condensed matter physics and quantum field theory. After an introduction including a very brief historical overview of the subject, we derive a path integral expression for the propagator in quantum mechanics, including the free particle and harmonic oscillator as examples. We then discuss a variety of applications, including path integrals in multiply-connected spaces, Euclidean path integrals and statistical mechanics, perturbation theory in quantum mechanics and in quantum field theory, and instantons via path integrals. For the most part, the emphasis is on explicit calculations in the familiar setting of quantum mechanics, with some discussion (often brief and schematic) of how these ideas can be applied to more complicated situations such as field theory.},

To describe the BV formalism in the context of noncommutative geometry, we define two finite spectral triples: the BV spectral triple and the BV auxiliary spectral triple. These are constructed from the gauge fields, ghost fields and anti-fields that enter the BV construction. We show that their fermionic actions add up precisely to the BV action. This approach allows for a geometric description of the ghost fields and their properties in terms of the BV spectral triple.},

The protocol is carried out with a pair of photons, whose initial maximally entangled state is destroyed by local decoherence prior to teleportation. It is demonstrated that the presence of strong nonlocal memory effects, which arise from initial correlations between the environments of the photons, allow to restore perfect teleportation. We further analyze how the amount of initial correlations within the environment affects the fidelity of the protocol, and find that for a moderate amount of correlations the fidelity exceeds the one of the previously known optimal teleportation protocol without memory effects. Our results show that memory effects can be exploited in harnessing noisy quantum systems for quantum communication and that non-Markovianity is a resource for quantum information tasks.},

In this framework, a quantum field theory is modelled by a functor from a category of spacetimes to a category of ($C^*$)-algebras obeying supplementary conditions. Among other things: (a) the key idea of relative Cauchy evolution is described in detail, and related to the stress-energy tensor; (b) a systematic "rigidity argument" is used to generalise results from flat to curved spacetimes; (c) a detailed discussion of the issue of selection of physical states is given, linking notions of stability at microscopic, mesoscopic and macroscopic scales; (d) the notion of subtheories and global gauge transformations are formalised; (e) it is shown that the general framework excludes the possibility of there being a single preferred state in each spacetime, if the choice of states is local and covariant. Many of the ideas are illustrated by the example of the free Klein-Gordon theory, which is given a new "universal definition".},

Elucidating this correspondence in the continuum formulation of topological phases, even in the simplest case of a one-dimensional system, touches upon fundamental concepts and methods in quantum mechanics that are not commonly discussed in textbooks, in particular the self-adjoint extensions of a Hermitian operator. We show how such topological bound states can be derived in a prototypical one-dimensional system. Along the way, we provide a pedagogical exposition of the self-adjoint extension method as well as the role of symmetries in correctly formulating the continuum, field-theory description of topological matter with boundaries. Moreover, we show that self-adjoint extensions can be characterized generally in terms of a conserved local current associated with the self-adjoint operator.},

While this algebraic approach is straightforward for bosons, in the case of fermions it is subtler since one has to distinguish between micro-causality, that is the anti-commutativity of the basic creation and annihilation operators, and algebraic independence that is the commutativity of local observables. We argue that a consistent algebraic formulation of separability and entanglement should be compatible with micro-causality rather than with algebraic independence.},

The Kramers-Wannier duality defect extends the Monster group to a larger category of topological defect lines that contains an Ising subcategory. We introduce the defect McKay-Thompson series defined as the Monster partition function twisted by the duality defect, and find that the coefficients can be decomposed into the dimensions of the (projective) irreducible representations of the Baby Monster group. We further prove that the defect McKay-Thompson series is invariant under the genus-zero congruence subgroup $16D^0$ of $PSL(2,\mathbb{Z})$.},

abstract = {We present the experimental implementation and theoretical model of a controllable dephasing quantum channel using photonic systems. The channel is implemented by coupling the polarization and the spatial distribution of light, that play, in the perspective of Open Quantum Systems, the role of quantum system and environment, respectively. The capability of controlling our channel allows us to visualize its effects in a quantum system. Differently from standard dephasing channels, our channel presents an exotic behavior in the sense that the evolution of a state, from a pure to a mixed state, shows an oscillatory behavior if tracked in the Bloch sphere. Additionally, we report the evolution of the purity and perform a quantum process tomography to obtain the \chi matrix associated to our channel.},

abstract = {The Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism in quantum field theory was originally invented to avoid the difficult problem of finding diagrammatic descriptions of oscillating integrals with degenerate critical points. But since then, BV algebras have become interesting objects of study in their own right, and mathematicians sometimes have good understanding of the homological aspects of the story without any access to the diagrammatics. In this note we reverse the usual direction of argument: we begin by asking for an explicit calculation of the homology of a BV algebra, and from it derive Wick's Theorem and the other Feynman rules for finite-dimensional integrals.},

abstract = {While many scientists are familiar with fractals, fewer are familiar with scale-invariance and universality which underly the ubiquity of their shapes. These properties may emerge from the collective behaviour of simple fundamental constituents, and are studied using statistical field theories. Initial chapters connect the particulate perspective developed in the companion volume, to the coarse grained statistical fields studied here. Based on lectures taught by Professor Kardar at MIT, this textbook demonstrates how such theories are formulated and studied. Perturbation theory, exact solutions, renormalization groups, and other tools are employed to demonstrate the emergence of scale invariance and universality, and the non-equilibrium dynamics of interfaces and directed paths in random media are discussed. Ideal for advanced graduate courses in statistical physics, it contains an integrated set of problems, with solutions to selected problems at the end of the book and a complete set available to lecturers at www.cambridge.org/9780521873413.},

Then they are generalised to being quantum reversible, i.e.$\$ unitary. (The classical networks we generalise are called feedforward, and have step-function activation functions.) The quantum network can be trained efficiently using gradient descent on a cost function to perform quantum generalisations of classical tasks. We demonstrate numerically that it can: (i) compress quantum states onto a minimal number of qubits, creating a quantum autoencoder, and (ii) discover quantum communication protocols such as teleportation. Our general recipe is theoretical and implementation-independent. The quantum neuron module can naturally be implemented photonically.},

@book{Tu,
abstract = {This text presents a graduate-level introduction to differential geometry for mathematics and physics students. The exposition follows the historical development of the concepts of connection and curvature with the goal of explaining the Chern-Weil theory of characteristic classes on a principal bundle. Along the way we encounter some of the high points in the history of differential geometry, for example, Gauss' Theorema Egregium and the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. Exercises throughout the book test the reader's understanding of the material and sometimes illustrate extensions of the theory. Initially, the prerequisites for the reader include a passing familiarity with manifolds. After the first chapter, it becomes necessary to understand and manipulate differential forms. A knowledge of de Rham cohomology is required for the last third of the text. Prerequisite material is contained in author's text An Introduction to Manifolds, and can be learned in one semester. For the benefit of the reader and to establish common notations, Appendix A recalls the basics of manifold theory. Additionally, in an attempt to make the exposition more self-contained, sections on algebraic constructions such as the tensor product and the exterior power are included. Differential geometry, as its name implies, is the study of geometry using differential calculus. It dates back to Newton and Leibniz in the seventeenth century, but it was not until the nineteenth century, with the work of Gauss on surfaces and Riemann on the curvature tensor, that differential geometry flourished and its modern foundation was laid. Over the past one hundred years, differential geometry has proven indispensable to an understanding of the physical world, in Einstein's general theory of relativity, in the theory of gravitation, in gauge theory, and now in string theory. Differential geometry is also useful in topology, several complex variables, algebraic geometry, complex manifolds, and dynamical systems, among other fields. The field has even found applications to group theory as in Gromov's work and to probability theory as in Diaconis's work. It is not too far-fetched to argue that differential geometry should be in every mathematician's arsenal. Preface -- Chapter 1. Curvature and Vector Fields -- 1. Riemannian Manifolds -- 2.

In the analysis of the short-term effects of particulate matter on daily mortality, Poisson regression models with flexible smoothing methods have been developed for the analysis of time-series data. Another option for such studies is the use of case-crossover designs, and there have been extensive discussions on the selection of control periods. In the Study on Respiratory Disease and Automobile Exhaust project conducted by the Japanese Ministry of the Environment, we adopted a new 2-stage case-control design that is efficient when both exposure and disease are rare. Based on our experience in conducting air pollution epidemiologic studies, we review 2-stage case-control designs, case-crossover designs, generalized linear models, generalized additive models, and generalized estimating equations, all of which are useful approaches in environmental epidemiology.},

In addition to rigorously constructing the theory, we also explain how it applies to a large class of closely related 3-dimensional theories and some of the consequences for factorization algebras of observables.},

Two examples of such information-transfer are given, first in the quantum mechanics of a pair of coupled subsystems, and then for the free scalar field in flat spacetime. It is argued that this problem leaves the Hilbert space formulation of quantum field theory with no definite measurement theory, removing whatever advantages it may have seemed to possess vis a vis the sum-over-histories approach, and reinforcing the view that a sum-over-histories framework is the most promising one for quantum gravity.},

This monograph presents a thoroughly modern framework to make linear response theory rigorous for a wide array of systems, that is suitable for novel applications such as periodic and random light conductors not yet covered in the literature. Our analytic-algebraic approach, based on von Neumann algebras and associated non-commutative $L^p$-spaces, can deal with discrete and continuous models alike, and include effects of disorder. First, we explain the mathematical setting, give a complete list of our hypotheses and state the main results, which include Kubo and Kubo-Streda formulas. To make our book accessible to a wide audience, we spend Chapters 3 and 4 explaining the mathematical underpinnings such as non-commutative $L^p$- and Sobolev spaces, and generalized commutators. Furthermore, we show how to construct a von Neumann algebras from a topological dynamical system and a 2-cocycle, a procedure which applies to discrete and continuous quantum systems. We dedicate Chapters 5 and 6 to the proofs of our main results. We close the book by sketching a novel application, linear response theory for periodic and random light conductors. This monograph is aimed at advanced students in mathematical physics and researchers.},

@article{Fuster2005,
abstract = {Most of the known models describing the fundamental interactions have a gauge freedom. In the standard path integral, it is necessary to "fix the gauge" in order to avoid integrating over unphysical degrees of freedom. Gauge independence might then become a tricky issue, especially when the structure of the gauge symmetries is intricate. In the modern approach to this question, it is the BRST invariance that effectively implements the gauge invariance. This set of lectures briefly reviews some key ideas underlying the BRST-antifield formalism, which yields a systematic procedure to path-integrate any type of gauge system, while (usually) manifestly preserving space-time covariance. The quantized theory possesses a global invariance under the so-called BRST transformation, which is nilpotent of order two. The cohomology of the BRST differential is the central element that controls the physics. Its relationship with the observables is sketched and explained. How anomalies appear in the "quantum master equation" of the antifield formalism is also discussed. These notes are based on the lectures given by MH at the 10th Saalburg Summer School on Modern Theoretical Methods from the 30th of August to the 10th of September, 2004 in Wolfersdorf, Germany and were prepared by AF and AM. The exercises which were discussed at the school are also included. {\textcopyright} World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract = {For a quantum field in a thermal equilibrium state we discuss the group generated by time translations and the modular action associated with an algebra invariant under half-sided translations. The modular flows associated with the algebras of the forward light cone and a space-like wedge admit a simple geometric description in two dimensional models that factorize in light-cone coordinates. At large distances from the domain boundary compared to the inverse temperature the flow pattern is essentially the same as time translations, whereas the zero temperature results are approximately reproduced close to the edge of the wedge and the apex of the cone. Associated with each domain there is also a one parameter group with a positive generator, for which the thermal state is a ground state. Formally, this may be regarded as a certain converse of the Unruh-effect.},

@article{Kaplanek2019,
abstract = {We compute how an accelerating qubit coupled to a scalar field - i.e. an Unruh-DeWitt detector - evolves in flat space, with an emphasis on its late-time behaviour. When calculable, the qubit evolves towards a thermal state for a field prepared in the Minkowski vacuum, with the approach to this limit controlled by two different time-scales. For a free field we compute both of these as functions of the difference between qubit energy levels, the dimensionless qubit/field coupling constant, the scalar field mass and the qubit's proper acceleration. Both time-scales differ from the Candelas-Deutsch-Sciama transition rate traditionally computed for Unruh-DeWitt detectors, which we show describes the qubit's early-time evolution away from the vacuum rather than its late-time approach to equilibrium. For small enough couplings and sufficiently late times the evolution is Markovian and described by a Lindblad equation, which we derive in detail from first principles as a special instance of Open EFT methods designed to handle a breakdown of late-time perturbative predictions due to the presence of secular growth. We show how this growth is resummed in this example to give reliable information about late-time evolution including both qubit/field interactions and field self-interactions. By allowing very explicit treatment, the qubit/field system allows a systematic assessment of the approximations needed when exploring late-time evolution, in a way that lends itself to gravitational applications. It also allows a comparison of these approximations with those - e.g. the `rotating-wave' approximation - widely made in the open-system literature (which is aimed more at atomic transitions and lasers).},

@article{Data2016,
abstract = {This talk reviews the constraints imposed by binary-pulsar data on gravity theories, focusing on ``tensor-scalar'' ones which are the best motivated alternatives to general relativity. We recall that binary-pulsar tests are qualitatively different from solar-system experiments, because of nonperturbative strong-field effects which can occur in compact objects like neutron stars, and because one can observe the effect of gravitational radiation damping. Some theories which are strictly indistinguishable from general relativity in the solar system are ruled out by binary-pulsar observations. During the last months, several impressive new experimental data have been published. Today, the most constraining binary pulsar is no longer the celebrated (Hulse-Taylor) PSR B1913+16, but the neutron star-white dwarf system PSR J1141-6545. In particular, in a region of the ``theory space'', solar-system tests were known to give the tightest constraints; PSR J1141-6545 is now almost as powerful. We also comment on the possible scalar-field effects for the detection of gravitational waves with future interferometers. The presence of a scalar partner to the graviton might be detectable with the LISA space experiment, but we already know that it would have a negligible effect for LIGO and VIRGO, so that the general relativistic wave templates can be used securely for these ground interferometers.},

abstract = {With the spinor analysis developed by B. van der Waerden which comprises all representations of the Lorentz group, even those not contained in ordinary tensor calculus, one is able to write all derivations and equations in an automatically covariant form. For the convenient translation into spinor language of the Maxwell equations, it becomes important to introduce three self-dual tensors, one representing the electromagnetic field, one corresponding to the Hertzian vector, and one representing a kind of current potential. These correspond to symmetric spinors of the 2nd rank. Many spinor equations thus become simpler than the corresponding tensorial equations, especially the expression for the stress energy tensor. From the 1st order Dirac equations in spinor form, as given by v.d. Waerden, we derived the 2nd order equation, which agrees with the Gordon-Klein form but for a correction term which again contains the self-dual field tensor. Further the expression for the current was derived, and its decomposition into conduction and polarization currents, and both Maxwell and Dirac equations were derived from a spinorial variation principle, analogous to the results of Gordon and Darwin. In addition to the divergence condition for the current three new invariant relations between the wave functions which are independent of the potentials were obtained (Chapter III, Eqs. (11), (12) and (13)).},

@article{Doplicher2013,
abstract = {In the special case of a spherically symmetric solution of Einstein equations coupled to a scalar massless field, we examine the consequences on the exact solution imposed by a semiclassical treatment of gravitational interaction when the scalar field is quantized. In agreement with Doplicheretal. (1995) [2], imposing the principle of gravitational stability against localization of events, we find that the region where an event is localized, or where initial conditions can be assigned, has a minimal extension, of the order of the Planck length. This conclusion, though limited to the case of spherical symmetry, is more general than that of [2] since it does not require the use of the notion of energy through the Heisenberg Principle, nor of any approximation as the linearized Einstein equations.We shall then describe the influence of this minimal length scale in a cosmological model, namely a simple universe filled with radiation, which is effectively described by a conformally coupled scalar field in a conformal KMS state. Solving the backreaction, a power law inflation scenario appears close to the initial singularity. Furthermore, the initial singularity becomes light like and thus the standard horizon problem is avoided in this simple model. This indication goes in the same direction as those drawn at a heuristic level from a full use of the principle of gravitational stability against localization of events, which point to a background dependence of the effective Planck length, through which a-causal effects may be transmitted. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Balachandran2011,
abstract = {There are several instances where quantum anomalies of continuous and discrete classical symmetries play an important role in fundamental physics. Examples come from chiral anomalies in the Standard Model of fundamental interactions and gravitational anomalies in string theories. Their generic origin is the fact that classical symmetries may not preserve the domains of quantum operators like the Hamiltonian. In this work, we show by simple examples that anomalous symmetries can often be implemented at the expense of working with mixed states having non-zero entropies. In particular there is the result on color breaking by non-abelian magnetic monopoles. This anomaly can be rectified by using impure states. We also argue that non-abelian groups of twisted bundles are always anomalous for pure states sharpening an earlier argument of Sorkin and Balachandran. This is the case of mapping class groups of geons indicating that "large" diffeos are anomalous for pure states in the presence of geons. Nevertheless diffeo invariance may be restored by using impure states. This work concludes with examples of these ideas drawn from molecular physics. The above approach using impure states is entirely equivalent to restricting all states to the algebra of observables invariant under the anomalous symmetries. For anomalous gauge groups such as color, this would mean that we work with observables singlet under global gauge transformations. For color, this will mean that we work with color singlets, a reasonable constraint.},

abstract = {Attenuation is the reduction of the intensity of an x-ray beam as it traverses matter. The reduction may be caused by absorption or by deflection (scatter) of photons from the beam and can be affected by different factors such as beam energy and atomic number of the absorber. An attenuation coefficient is a measure of the quantity of radiation attenuation by a given thickness of absorber. Linear and mass attenuation coefficients are the coefficients used most often. The equation I = Ioe-mu x expresses the exponential relationship between incident primary photons and transmitted photons for a monoenergetic beam with respect to the thickness of the absorber and thus may be used to calculate the attenuation by any thickness of material. The quality or penetrating ability of an x-ray beam is usually described by stating its half-value layer (HVL). Another parameter used to describe the penetrating ability of a beam is the homogeneity coefficient. Among other things, use of added filtration reduces the intensity of the x-ray beam, increases the HVL, decreases patient exposure, and improves image quality for a given radiation dose.},

abstract = {For any Lie groupoid $G$, the vector bundle $g^*$ dual to the associated Lie algebroid $g$ is canonically a Poisson manifold. The (reduced) C*-algebra of $G$ (as defined by A. Connes) is shown to be a strict quantization (in the sense of M. Rieffel) of $g^*$. This is proved using a generalization of Weyl's quantization prescription on flat space. Many other known strict quantizations are a special case of this procedure; on a Riemannian manifold, one recovers Connes' tangent groupoid as well as a recent generalization of Weyl's prescription. When $G$ is the gauge groupoid of a principal bundle one is led to the Weyl quantization of a particle moving in an external Yang-Mills field. In case that $G$ is a Lie group (with Lie algebra $g$) one recovers Rieffel's quantization of the Lie-Poisson structure on $g^*$. A transformation group C*-algebra defined by a smooth action of a Lie group on a manifold $Q$ turns out to be the quantization of the semidirect product Poisson manifold $g^*x Q$ defined by this action.},

@article{Kibble1961,
abstract = {An argument leading from the Lorentz invariance of the Lagrangian to the introduction of the gravitational field is presented. Utiyama&apos;s discussion is extended by considering the 10‐parameter group of inhomogeneous Lorentz transformations, involving variation of the coordinates as well as the field variables. It is then unnecessary to introduce a priori curvilinear coordinates or a Riemannian metric, and the new field variables introduced as a consequence of the argument include the vierbein components hk $\mu$ as well as the ``local affine connection&apos;&apos; Ai j$\mu$ . The extended transformations for which the 10 parameters become arbitrary functions of position may be interpreted as general coordinate transformations and rotations of the vierbein system. The free Lagrangian for the new fields is shown to be a function of two covariant quantities analogous to F$\mu$$\nu$ for the electromagnetic field, and the simplest possible form is just the usual curvature scalar density expressed in terms of hk $\mu$ and Ai j$\mu$ . This Lagrangian is of first order in the derivatives, and is the analog for the vierbein formalism of Palatini&apos;s Lagrangian. In the absence of matter, it yields the familiar equationsR$\mu$$\nu$ =0 for empty space, but when matter is present there is a difference from the usual theory (first pointed out by Weyl) which arises from the fact that Ai j$\mu$ appears in the matter field Lagrangian, so that the equation of motion relating Ai j$\mu$ to hk $\mu$ is changed. In particular, this means that, although the covariant derivative of the metric vanishes, the affine connection $\Gamma$$\lambda$ $\mu$$\nu$ is nonsymmetric. The theory may be reexpressed in terms of the Christoffel connection, and in that case additional terms quadratic in the ``spin density&apos;&apos; Sk ij appear in the Lagrangian. These terms are almost certainly too small to make any experimentally detectable difference to the predictions of the usual metric theory.},

By using the algebraic formulation of quantum theory, we propose a unifying perspective on these problems, based on the hypothesis that in a generally covariant quantum theory the physical time-flow is not a universal property of the mechanical theory, but rather it is determined by the thermodynamical state of the system ("thermal time hypothesis"). We implement this hypothesis by using a key structural property of von Neumann algebras: the Tomita-Takesaki theorem, which allows to derive a time-flow, namely a one-parameter group of automorphisms of the observable algebra, from a generic thermal physical state. We study this time-flow, its classical limit, and we relate it to various characteristic theoretical facts, as the Unruh temperature and the Hawking radiation. We also point out the existence of a state-independent notion of "time", given by the canonical one-parameter subgroup of outer automorphisms provided by the Cocycle Radon-Nikodym theorem.},

Whereas a local unitary transformation of the system does not affect its coherence, global unitary transformations modifying both the system and its surroundings can enhance its coherence, transforming mutual correlations into coherence. The question naturally arises of what is the best measure that quantifies the correlations that can be turned into coherence, and how much coherence can be extracted. We answer both questions, and illustrate its application for some typical simple systems, with the aim at illuminating the general concept of enhancing coherence by modifying correlations.},

We concentrate on the case of nearly-$AdS_2$ gravity and discuss a very simple mechanical picture for the gravitational dynamics. We derive a formula for the two sided correlators that includes the effect of gravitational backreaction, which limits the amount of information we can send through the wormhole. We emphasize that the process can be viewed as a teleportation protocol where the teleportee feels nothing special as he/she goes through the wormhole. We discuss some applications to the cloning paradox for old black holes. We point out that the same formula we derived for $AdS_2$ gravity is also valid for the simple SYK quantum mechanical theory, around the thermofield double state. We present a heuristic picture for this phenomenon in terms of an operator growth model. Finally, we show that a similar effect is present in a completely classical chaotic system with a large number of degrees of freedom.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {A spin-1/2 system on a honeycomb lattice is studied. The interactions between nearest neighbors are of XX, YY or ZZ type, depending on the direction of the link; different types of interactions may differ in strength. The model is solved exactly by a reduction to free fermions in a static ℤ2 gauge field. A phase diagram in the parameter space is obtained. One of the phases has an energy gap and carries excitations that are Abelian anyons. The other phase is gapless, but acquires a gap in the presence of magnetic field. In the latter case excitations are non-Abelian anyons whose braiding rules coincide with those of conformal blocks for the Ising model. We also consider a general theory of free fermions with a gapped spectrum, which is characterized by a spectral Chern number v. The Abelian and non-Abelian phases of the original model correspond to v = 0 and v = ±1, respectively. The anyonic properties of excitation depend on v mod 16, whereas v itself governs edge thermal transport. The paper also provides mathematical background on anyons as well as an elementary theory of Chern number for quasidiagonal matrices. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The notion of a C *-algebra generated by a finite sequence of unbounded elements is introduced and investigated. It is generalized to include continuous quantum families of generators. An essential part of the duality theory for C *-algebras is presented including complete proofs of many theorems announced in [17]. The results are used to develop a presentation method of introducing non-unital C *-algebras. Numerous examples related mainly to the quantum group theory are presented.},

abstract = {Random quantum circuits yield minimally structured models for chaotic quantum dynamics, which are able to capture, for example, universal properties of entanglement growth. We provide exact results and coarse-grained models for the spreading of operators by quantum circuits made of Haar-random unitaries. We study both 1+1D and higher dimensions and argue that the coarse-grained pictures carry over to operator spreading in generic many-body systems. In 1+1D, we demonstrate that the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC) satisfies a biased diffusion equation, which gives exact results for the spatial profile of the OTOC and determines the butterfly speed vB. We find that in 1+1D, the "front" of the OTOC broadens diffusively, with a width scaling in time as t1/2. We address fluctuations in the OTOC between different realizations of the random circuit, arguing that they are negligible in comparison to the broadening of the front within a realization. Turning to higher dimensions, we show that the averaged OTOC can be understood exactly via a remarkable correspondence with a purely classical droplet growth problem. This implies that the width of the front of the averaged OTOC scales as t1/3 in 2+1D and as t0.240 in 3+1D (exponents of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class). We support our analytic argument with simulations in 2+1D. We point out that, in two or higher spatial dimensions, the shape of the spreading operator at late times is affected by underlying lattice symmetries and, in general, is not spherical. However, when full spatial rotational symmetry is present in 2+1D, our mapping implies an exact asymptotic form for the OTOC, in terms of the Tracy-Widom distribution. For an alternative perspective on the OTOC in 1+1D, we map it to the partition function of an Ising-like statistical mechanics model. As a result of special structure arising from unitarity, this partition function reduces to a random walk calculation which can be performed exactly. We also use this mapping to give exact results for entanglement growth in 1+1D circuits.},

The magnetization results illustrate two magnetic anomalies at 7 and 4 K. The Rietveld analysis of room temperature x-ray diffraction and NPD data confirms its Ia-3d crystal structure. The temperature dependent NPD shows the emergence of magnetic reflections below 7 K whose intensity keeps on increasing with decreasing temperature down to 1.5 K. The crystal structure remains cubic down to 1.5 K. Rietveld analysis reveals that below 7 K, the Ni moments in CNVO undergo a commensurate collinear A-type antiferromagnetic ordering with propagation vector k=(0,0,0) and the per site ordered moment of Ni2+ is 1.69±0.05 $\mu$B. Absence of any additional magnetic or nuclear reflections below 4 K confirms that the nuclear and magnetic structures remain invariant across the 4 K magnetic anomaly.},

The book chapters include: - foundations of jet bundles and analysis of differential forms and vector fields on jet bundles, - the theory of higher-order integral variational functionals for sections of a fibred space, the (global) first variational formula in infinitesimal and integral forms- extremal conditions and the discussion of Noether symmetries and generalizations,- the inverse problems of the calculus of variations of Helmholtz type- variational sequence theory and its consequences for the global inverse problem (cohomology conditions)- examples of variational functionals of mathematical physics.

abstract = {Quantum indistinguishability plays a crucial role in many low-energy physical phenomena, from quantum fluids to molecular spectroscopy. It is, however, typically ignored in most high temperature processes, particularly for ionic coordinates, implicitly assumed to be distinguishable, incoherent and thus well-approximated classically. We explore chemical reactions involving small symmetric molecules, and argue that in many situations a full quantum treatment of collective nuclear degrees of freedom is essential. Supported by several physical arguments, we conjecture a "Quantum Dynamical Selection" (QDS) rule for small symmetric molecules that precludes chemical processes that involve direct transitions from orbitally non-symmetric molecular states. As we propose and discuss, the implications of the Quantum Dynamical Selection rule include: (i) a differential chemical reactivity of para- and ortho-hydrogen, (ii) a mechanism for inducing inter-molecular quantum entanglement of nuclear spins, (iii) a new isotope fractionation mechanism, (iv) a novel explanation of the enhanced chemical activity of "Reactive Oxygen Species", (v) illuminating the importance of ortho-water molecules in modulating the quantum dynamics of liquid water, (vi) providing the critical quantum-to-biochemical linkage in the nuclear spin model of the (putative) quantum brain, among others.},

We extend the classical BRST formalism to arbitrary pseudo-Euclidean vector bundles (E\to M_{0}) by canonically associating to such a bundle a graded symplectic supermanifold ((M,\Omega)), with (\textrm{deg}(\Omega)=2). Conversely, every such manifold arises in this way. We describe the algebra of functions on (M) in terms of (E) and show that ``BRST charges'' on (M) correspond to Courant algebroid structures on (E), thereby constructing the standard complex for the latter as a generalization of the classical BRST complex. As an application of these ideas, we prove the acyclicity of ``higher de Rham complexes'', a generalization of a classic result of Fr\"{o}hlicher-Nijenhuis, and derive several easy but useful corollaries.},

abstract = {A generator of a symmetry or supersymmetry of the S-matrix has to have three simple properties (see sect. 2). Starting from these properties one can give a complete analysis of the possible structure of the pseudo Lie algebra of these generators. In a theory with non-vanishing masses one finds that the only extension of previously known relations is the possible appearance of "central charges" as anticommutators of Fermi charges. In the massless case (disregarding infrared problems and symmetry breaking) the Fermi charges may generate the conformal group together with a unitary internal symmetry group. {\textcopyright} 1975.},

In the quantum version of the theory, the state of higher energy density becomes unstable through barrier penetration; it is a false vacuum. This is the first of two papers developing the qualitative and quantitative semiclassical theory of the decay of such a false vacuum for theories of a single scalar field with nonderivative interactions. In the limit of vanishing energy density between the two ground states, it is possible to obtain explicit expressions for the relevant quantities to leading order in h; in the more general case, the problem can be reduced to solving a single nonlinear ordinary differential equation. {\textcopyright} 1977 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {I argue that a version of the quantum-corrected Ryu–Takayanagi formula holds in any quantum error-correcting code. I present this result as a series of theorems of increasing generality, with the final statement expressed in the language of operator-algebra quantum error correction. In AdS/CFT this gives a “purely boundary” interpretation of the formula. I also extend a recent theorem, which established entanglement-wedge reconstruction in AdS/CFT, when interpreted as a subsystem code, to the more general, and I argue more physical, case of subalgebra codes. For completeness, I include a self-contained presentation of the theory of von Neumann algebras on finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, as well as the algebraic definition of entropy. The results confirm a close relationship between bulk gauge transformations, edge-modes/soft-hair on black holes, and the Ryu–Takayanagi formula. They also suggest a new perspective on the homology constraint, which basically is to get rid of it in a way that preserves the validity of the formula, but which removes any tension with the linearity of quantum mechanics. Moreover, they suggest a boundary interpretation of the “bit threads” recently introduced by Freedman and Headrick.},

It covers technical and interpretational aspects alike,and includes both traditional topics and newer areas such as quantuminformation and its relatives. The central concepts that have shapedcontemporary understanding of the quantum world are clearly defined, withillustrations where helpful, and discussed at a level suitable forundergraduate and graduate students of physics, history of science, andphilosophy of physics. All articles share three main aims: (1) to provide aclear definition and understanding of the term concerned; (2) where possible,to trace the historical origins of the concept; and (3) to provide a small butoptimal selection of references to the most relevant literature, includingpertinent historical studies. Also discussed are the often contentiousphilosophical implications derived from quantum theory and its associatedexperimental findings.This compendium will be an indispensable resource for all those seekingconcise up-to-date information about the many facets of quantum physics.},

Some operator theory and a first exposure to von Neu-mann algebras After introducing concrete and abstract von Neumann alge-bras, we give a crash course on the two pillars of operator theory in Hilbert space: the spectral theorem and the polar decomposition theorem. And we finish with some basic von Neumann algebra theory. 3. Normality We discuss some of the equivalent descriptions of what it takes to belong to the pre-dual of a von Neumann algebra, as well as demonstrate the equivalence of the concrete and abstract descriptions of a von Neumann algebra. 4. The standard form of von Neumann algebras We discuss what may be considered the analogue in von Neu-mann algebra theory of the existence and uniquenes of Haar measure in the theory of locally compact groups. 5. The Tomita-Takesaki Theorem We discuss: states and weights, the GNS construction for weights, the Tomita-Takesaki theorem, modular automorphism groups, Connes' unitary cocycle theorem, ... 6. Factors We conclude with a brief discussion of factors, the Murray-von Neumann classification of them, the crossed-product construction, and examples of factors.},

Moreover, we show how the factorization algebra recovers the BRST cohomology of the string and give another construction of the Gerstenhaber structure. Finally, we show how the factorization homology along closed manifolds encodes the determinant line bundle over the moduli space of Riemann surfaces.},

At the same time, the subjects are related to real measurements and to the experimental techniques and devices currently used by physicists in academe and industry. Books in this series are written as course books, and include ample tutorial material, examples, illustrations, revision points, and problem sets.

This book introduces the main ideas of quantum mechanics in language familiar to mathematicians. Readers with little prior exposure to physics will enjoy the book's conversational tone as they delve into such topics as the Hilbert space approach to quantum theory; the Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation in one space dimension; the Spectral Theorem for bounded and unbounded self-adjoint operators; the Stone–von Neumann Theorem; the Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin approximation; the role of Lie groups and Lie algebras in quantum mechanics; and the path-integral approach to quantum mechanics. The numerous exercises at the end of each chapter make the book suitable for both graduate courses and independent study. Most of the text is accessible to graduate students in mathematics who have had a first course in real analysis, covering the basics of L2 spaces and Hilbert spaces. The final chapters introduce readers who are familiar with the theory of manifolds to more advanced topics, including geometric quantization.},

abstract = {{In these lecture notes prepared for the 11th Taiwan Spring School, Taipei 1997}, and updated for the Saalburg summer school 1998, we review the solutions of O(N) or U(N) models in the large N limit and as 1/N expansions, in the case of vector representations. The general idea is that invariant composite fields have small fluctuations for N large. Therefore the method relies on constructing effective field theories for these composite fields after integration over the initial degrees of freedom. We illustrate these ideas by showing that the large N expansion allows to relate the phib^2^2 theory and the non-linear sigma-model, models which are renormalizable in different dimensions. In the same way large N techniques allow to relate the Gross--Neveu, an example of a theory with four-fermi self-interaction, with a Yukawa-type theory renormalizable in four dimensions, a topic relevant for four dimensional field theory. Among other issues for which large N methods are also useful we will briefly discuss finite size effects and finite temperature field theory, because they involve a crossover between different dimensions.\par Finally we consider the case of a general scalar V(phib^2) field theory, explain how the large N techniques can be generalized, and discuss some connected issues like tricritical behaviour and double scaling limit. Some sections in these notes are directly adapted from the work Zinn-Justin J., 1989, Quantum Field Theory and Critical Phenomena, Clarendon Press (Oxford third ed. 1996).},

The magnetic problem is treated in the Ginzburg-Landau version. In this way we are able to perform the calculations for systems of finite size and thereby execute the n $\sim$0 limit in the proper way. A further advantage of our calculational approach is that it allows us to investigate the effects of restricted geometries. We demonstrate how to extract results for the one polymer system and ex- plore its thermodynamic behavior in the mean-field and spin-wave approximation above and below the phase transition. Correspondence between Flory's classical approach to understanding polymers and the magnetic analogy is derived and a calculational procedure for improvement and new insights are developed.},

However, the wavefront set is a somewhat subtle concept whose standard definition is not easy to grasp. This paper is a step-by-step introduction to the wavefront set, with examples and motivation. Many different definitions and new interpretations of the wavefront set are presented. Some of them involve a Radon transform.},

@article{Berry1997,
abstract = {The quantum mechanics of two identical particles with spin S in three dimensions is reformulated by employing not the usual fixed spin basis but a transported spin basis that exchanges the spins along with the positions. Such a basis, required to be smooth and parallel-transported, can be generated by an 'exchange rotation' operator resembling angular momentum. This is constructed from the four harmonic oscillators from which the two spins are made according to Schwinger's scheme. It emerges automatically that the phase factor accompanying spin exchange with the transported basis is just the Pauli sign, that is (-1)2S. Singlevaluedness of the total wavefunction, involving the transported basis, then implies the correct relation between spin and statistics. The Pauli sign is a geometric phase factor of topological origin, associated with non-contractible circuits in the doubly connected (and nonorientable) configuration space of relative positions with identified antipodes. The theory extends to more than two particles. {\textcopyright} 1997 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {The covariant phase space method of Iyer, Lee, Wald, and Zoupas gives an elegant way to understand the Hamiltonian dynamics of Lagrangian field theories without breaking covariance. The original literature however does not systematically treat total derivatives and boundary terms, which has led to some confusion about how exactly to apply the formalism in the presence of boundaries. In particular the original construction of the canonical Hamiltonian relies on the assumed existence of a certain boundary quantity "$B$", whose physical interpretation has not been clear. We here give an algorithmic procedure for applying the covariant phase space formalism to field theories with spatial boundaries, from which the term in the Hamiltonian involving $B$ emerges naturally. Our procedure also produces an additional boundary term, which was not present in the original literature and which so far has only appeared implicitly in specific examples, and which is already nonvanishing even in general relativity with sufficiently permissive boundary conditions. The only requirement we impose is that at solutions of the equations of motion the action is stationary modulo future/past boundary terms under arbitrary variations obeying the spatial boundary conditions; from this the symplectic structure and the Hamiltonian for any diffeomorphism that preserves the theory are unambiguously constructed. We show in examples that the Hamiltonian so constructed agrees with previous results. We also show that the Poisson bracket on covariant phase space directly coincides with the Peierls bracket, without any need for non-covariant intermediate steps, and we discuss possible implications for the entropy of dynamical black hole horizons.},

I have tried to cover all of the main aspects of “standard” or “clas- cal” operator algebra theory; the goal has been to be, well, encyclopedic.

abstract = {This paper gives a way to renormalise certain quantum field theories on compact manifolds. Examples include Yang-Mills theory (in dimension 4 only), Chern-Simons theory and holomorphic Chern-Simons theory. The method is within the framework of the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism. Chern-Simons theory is renormalised in a way respecting all symmetries (up to homotopy). This yields an invariant of smooth manifolds: a certain algebraic structure on the cohomology of the manifold tensored with a Lie algebra, which is a "higher loop" enrichment of the natural Lie-infinity structure.},

I summarize here this point of view, explaining why I think that in a fundamental description of nature we must "forget time", and how this can be done in the classical and in the quantum theory. The idea is to develop a formalism that treats dependent and independent variables on the same footing. In short, I propose to interpret mechanics as a theory of relations between variables, rather than the theory of the evolution of variables in time.},

@article{Borchers2000,
abstract = {In the book of Haag [Local Quantum Physics (Springer Verlag, Berlin, 1992)] about local quantum field theory the main results are obtained by the older methods of C * - and W * -algebra theory. A great advance, especially in the theory of W * -algebras, is due to Tomita's discovery of the theory of modular Hilbert algebras [Quasi-standard von Neumann algebras, Preprint (1967)]. Because of the abstract nature of the underlying concepts, this theory became (except for some sporadic results) a technique for quantum field theory only in the beginning of the nineties. In this review the results obtained up to this point will be collected and some problems for the future will be discussed at the end. In the first section the technical tools will be presented. Then in the second section two concepts, the half-sided translations and the half-sided modular inclusions, will be explained. These concepts have revolutionized the handling of quantum field theory. Examples for which the modular groups are explicitly known are presented in the third section. One of the important results of the new theory is the proof of the PCT theorem in the theory of local observables. Questions connected with the proof are discussed in Sec. IV. Section V deals with the structure of local algebras and with questions connected with symmetry groups. In Sec. VI a theory of tensor product decompositions will be presented. In the last section problems that are closely connected with the modular theory and that should be treated in the future will be discussed.},

The axioms of nonrelativistic quantum theory are introduced, and shown to lead to a variety of new conceptual problems. Subjects discussed include state-vector reduction, the problem of measurement, quantum entanglement, the Kochen-Specker theorem, and the Bell inequalities.

A dynamical model with infinite degrees of freedom that describes a Robertson-Walker universe with nonhomogeneous electromagnetic radiation is defined. Its statistical mechanics is studied by using the covariant statistical theory. A simple statistical state that represents the cosmic background radiation is constructed. The properties of this state support the general theory; in particular, the idea that a preferred time variable, denoted thermodynamical time, is singled out by the statistical state can be tested within this model. The thermodynamical time is computed and shown to agree with the standard Robertson-Walker time. In addition, an application of the general theory to a simple special relativistic system, and a proposal for an application to full general relativity are also presented. The relevance of this application for the physics of the very early universe is discussed.},

The key idea in controlled teleportation is that the teleportation is performed only with the participation of the controller. We calculate a quantitative measure of the controller's power and establish a lower bound on the control power required for controlled teleportation. We show that the maximally entangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state is a suitable channel for controlled teleportation of arbitrary single qubits-the controller's power meets the bound and the teleportation fidelity without the controller's permission is no better than the fidelity of a classical channel. We also construct partially entangled channels that exceed the bound for controlled teleportation of a restricted set of states called the equatorial states. We calculate the minimum entanglement required in these channels to exceed the bound. Moreover, we find that in these restricted controlled teleportation schemes, the partially entangled channels can outperform maximally entangled channels with respect to the controller's power. Our results provide an alternative perspective on controlled teleportation schemes and are of practical interest since we propose useful partially entangled channels.},

abstract = {D-branes are classified by twisted K-theory. Yet twisted K-theory is often hard to calculate. We argue that, in the case of a compactification on a simply-connected six manifold, twisted K-theory is isomorphic to a much simpler object, twisted homology. Unlike K-theory, homology can be twisted by a class of any degree and so it classifies not only D-branes but also M-branes. Twisted homology classes correspond to cycles in a certain bundle over spacetime, and branes may decay via Kachru-Pearson-Verlinde transitions only if this cycle is trivial. We provide a spectral sequence which calculates twisted homology, the kth step treats D(p-2k)-branes ending on Dp-branes.},

abstract = {We relate two classical dualities in low-dimensional quantum field theory: Kramers-Wannier duality of the Ising and related lattice models in $2$ dimensions, with electromagnetic duality for finite gauge theories in $3$ dimensions. The relation is mediated by the notion of boundary field theory: Ising models are boundary theories for pure gauge theory in one dimension higher. Thus the Ising order/disorder operators are endpoints of Wilson/'t Hooft defects of gauge theory. Symmetry breaking on low-energy states reflects the multiplicity of topological boundary states. In the process we describe lattice theories as (extended) topological field theories with boundaries and domain walls. This allows us to generalize the duality to non-abelian groups; finite, semi-simple Hopf algebras; and, in a different direction, to finite homotopy theories in arbitrary dimension.},

As pointed out to us by Sorkin, this happens if the GNS representation (of the algebra of observables in some quantum state) is reducible, and some representations in the decomposition occur with non-trivial degeneracy. This non-unique entropy can occur at zero temperature. We will argue elsewhere in detail that the degeneracies in the GNS representation can be interpreted as an emergent broken gauge symmetry, and play an important role in the analysis of emergent entropy due to non-Abelian anomalies.

@article{Martinetti2013,
abstract = {We discuss the emergence of time in quantum gravity, and ask whether time is always "something that flows"'. We first recall that this is indeed the case in both relativity and quantum mechanics, although in very different manners: time flows geometrically in relativity (i.e. as a flow of proper time in the four dimensional space-time), time flows abstractly in quantum mechanics (i.e. as a flow in the space of observables of the system). We then ask the same question in quantum gravity, in the light of the thermal time hypothesis of Connes and Rovelli. The latter proposes to answer the question of time in quantum gravity (or at least one of its many aspects), by postulating that time is a state dependent notion. This means that one is able to make a notion of time-as-an-abstract-flow - that we call the thermal time - emerge from the knowledge of both: 1) the algebra of observables of the physical system under investigation, 2) a state of thermal equilibrium of this system. Formally, this thermal time is similar to the abstract flow of time in quantum mechanics, but we show in various examples that it may have a concrete implementation either as a geometrical flow, or as a geometrical flow combined with a non-geometric action. This indicates that in quantum gravity, time may well still be "something that flows" at some abstract algebraic level, but this does not necessarily imply that time is always and only "something that flows" at the geometric level.},

@book{Cardona2017,
abstract = {This monograph presents various ongoing approaches to the vast topic of quantization, which is the process of forming a quantum mechanical system starting from a classical one, and discusses their numerous fruitful interactions with mathematics. The opening chapter introduces the various forms of quantization and their interactions with each other and with mathematics. A first approach to quantization, called deformation quantization, consists of viewing the Planck constant as a small parameter. This approach provides a deformation of the structure of the algebra of classical observables rather than a radical change in the nature of the observables. When symmetries come into play, deformation quantization needs to be merged with group actions, which is presented in chapter 2, by Simone Gutt. The noncommutativity arising from quantization is the main concern of noncommutative geometry. Allowing for the presence of symmetries requires working with principal fiber bundles in a non-commutative setup, where Hopf algebras appear naturally. This is the topic of chapter 3, by Christian Kassel. Nichols algebras, a special type of Hopf algebras, are the subject of chapter 4, by Nicol{\'{a}}s Andruskiewitsch. The purely algebraic approaches given in the previous chapters do not take the geometry of space-time into account. For this purpose a special treatment using a more geometric point of view is required. An approach to field quantization on curved space-time, with applications to cosmology, is presented in chapter 5 in an account of the lectures of Abhay Ashtekar that brings a complementary point of view to non-commutativity. An alternative quantization procedure is known under the name of string theory. In chapter 6 its supersymmetric version is presented. Superstrings have drawn the attention of many mathematicians, due to its various fruitful interactions with algebraic geometry, some of which are described here. The remaining chapters discuss further topics, as the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism and direct products of spectral triples. This volume addresses both physicists and mathematicians and serves as an introduction to ongoing research in very active areas of mathematics and physics at the border line between geometry, topology, algebra and quantum field theory.

@book{Holevo2011,
abstract = {The mathematical language of modern quantum mechanics is operator theory. Operators play there a role similar to functions in classical me- chanics, probability theory and statistics. However, while the use of func- tions in classical theories is founded on premises which seem intuitively quite clear, in quantum theory the situation with operators is different. Historically the “matrix mechanics” of Heisenberg and the “wave mechanics” of Schr¨odinger which gave rise to the contemporary form of quantum theory, originated from ingenious attempts to t mathemat- ical objects able to reect some unusual (from the macroscopic point of view) features of microparticle behavior – in particular, a peculiar combination of continuous and discrete properties. The “probabilistic interpretation” developed later by Born and others elucidated the mean- ing of operator formalism by postulating rules connecting mathematical objects with observable quantities. However a good deal of arbitrari- ness remained in these postulates and the most convincing argument for quantum-theoretical explanations was still the “striking” coincidence of theoretical predictions with experimental data. This state of affairs gave rise to numerous attempts, on one hand, to nd classical alternatives to quantum theory which would give an equally satisfactory description of the experimental data, and on the other hand, to nd out physical and philosophical arguments for justifying the inevitability of the new me- chanics. Notwithstanding the impressive philosophical achievements in this eld there was and still is a need for the structural investigation of quan- tum theory from a more mathematical point of view aimed at elucidating the connections between the entities of the physical world and the ele- ments of operator formalism. The present book is essentially in this line of research opened by the classical von Neumann's treatise “Mathemati- cal Foundations of Quantum Mechanics”. However it differs from most subsequent investigations by the strong emphasis on the statistical rather than “logical” essence of quantum theory; it gives an account of recentxiv Alexander Holevo progress in the statistical theory of quantum measurement, stimulated by the new applications of quantum mechanics, particularly in quantum op- tics. The rst three chapters give an introduction to the foundations of quan- tum mechanics, addressed to the reader interested in the structure of quantum theory and its relations with classical probability. In spite of the mathematical character of the presentation it is not “axiomatic”. Its purpose is to display the origin of the basic elements of operator formal- ism resting, as far as possible, upon the classical probabilistic concepts. The present revision is not an end in itself – it emerged from the so- lution of concrete problems concerning the quantum limitations to mea- surement accuracy, arising in applications. So far there has been no gen- eral approach to such kind of problems. The methods of mathemati- cal statistics adapted for classical measurements required radial quantum modication. The last chapters of the book are devoted to the recently developed quantum estimation theory, which is an analog of the corre- sponding branch of mathematical statistics. We now give a more detailed account of the contents of the book. In Chapter 1 the general concepts of state and measurement are introduced on the basis of statistical analysis of an experimental situation. From the very beginning this approach leads to a substantial generalization of the Dirac-von Neumann concept of an observable. Mathematically it is re- ected by the occurrence of arbitrary resolutions of identity in place of or- thogonal ones (spectral measures) and the repudiation of self-adjointness as an indispensable attribute of an observable. In this way nonorthog- onal resolutions of identity like the “overcomplete” system of coherent states known in physics for rather a long time nd their proper place in quantum phenomenology. The new concept of quantum measurement is central for the whole book. The notion of statistical model exploited in Chapter 1 is quite general and may nd applications different from quantum theory. It gives us a new insight into the still controversial “hidden variables” problem. In Chapter 2 the elements of operator theory in Hilbert space are intro- duced to provide mathematical background for the subsequent material. As compared to standard presentations relatively much attention is paid to nonorthogonal resolutions of identity and related questions. A novel feature is also the introduction of the L 2 spaces of observables associ- ated with a quantum state and playing a role similar to the Hilbert space of random variables with nite second moment in probability theory. These L 2 spaces give the framework for a calculus of unbounded operators. Of fundamental importance to quantum theory are groups of symme- tries. In Chapter 3 elementary quantum mechanics is considered from thisxv Probabilistic and Statistical Aspects of Quantum Theory point of view. An important result of this discussion is the isolation of the notion of covariant measurement which ties physical quantities with cer- tain classes of resolutions of identity in the underlying Hilbert space. In this way we construct quantum measurements canonically corresponding to such quantities as time, phase of harmonic oscillator, angle of rotation and joint measurement of coordinate and velocity. Allowing the broader concept of quantum measurement enables us to resolve old troubles of quantum theory connected with the non-existence of self-adjoint opera- tors having the required covariance properties. Chapter 4 is devoted to a more advanced study of covariant measure- ments and extreme quantum limits for the accuracy of estimation of phys- ical parameters. The latter problem becomes important in view of the progress in experimental physics. We present a unied statistical ap- proach to “non-standard” uncertainty relations of the “angle-angular mo- mentum” type. They appear to be related to the quantum analog of the Hunt-Stein theorem in mathematical statistics. A general conclusion which can be drawn from Chapter 4 is that the requirements of covariance and optimality, i.e., extremal quantum accuracy, determine the canoni- cal measurement of a “shift” parameter, such as angle, coordinate, time, uniquely up to a “gauge” transformation. An example of a situation where quantum limitations are important is provided by optical communication. As it is known, “quantum noise” dis- torting the signal in the optical range can be much more signicant than the thermal background radiation. As in ordinary communication theory the problem of signal estimation arises, but now it requires a specically quantum-theoretic formulation and solution. Chapter 5 is devoted to the so-called Gaussian states which, in par- ticular, describe radiation elds in optical communication theory. The presentation is intended to make maximal use of the remarkable parallel with the Gaussian probability distributions. An important role is played here by quantum characteristic functions. In Chapter 6 the general inequalities for the measurement mean square errors are derived, which are quantum analogs of the well-known Cramer- Rao inequality in mathematical statistics. The best unbiased measure- ments of the mean-value parameters of a Gaussian state are describ- ed. Needless to say, the present book cannot (and is not intended to) re- place the standard textbooks on quantum mechanics. Most of the impor- tant topics, such as perturbation theory, are apparently out of its scope. Nor does it pretend to give a full account of quantum measurements. We have discussed only those problems which concern measurement statis- tics and do not require consideration of state changes after measurements.The references to the relevant work on “open” quantum systems and quantum stochastic processes can be found in the comments. The author's intention was to write a book accessible to a wide circle of readers, both mathematicians and physicists. As a result, the presenta- tion, being in general mathematical, is rather informal and certainly not “the most economic” from a mathematical point of view. On the other hand, it neglects some subtleties concerning measurability etc. As a rule a rigorous treatment can be found in the special papers refered to. The necessary background for the whole material is knowledge of fundamen- tals of probability theory. Mathematically the most elementary is Chapter 1 which uses mainly nite-dimensional linear analysis. The functional analytic minimum is given in Section 2.1-2.6 of Chapter 2, and a math- ematically educated reader may just glance over it. On the other hand, a reader familiar with quantum mechanics can omit the detailed discussion of such topics as harmonic oscillators and spin in Chapter 3, included to make the presentation self-contained, and concentrate on less familiar things. The Dirac notation is used intensively throughout the book but with round brackets for the inner product as accepted in mathematical litera- ture. The angle brackets, associated with the averaging symbol in statis- tical mechanics, are reserved for the different inner product dening the correlation of a pair of observables. To denote a quantum state as well as its density operator we use the letter S (not the usual $\rho$ ) allied to the notation P for the classical state (probability distribution).

Rozanov and Prof. P. R. Krishnaiah for providing the opportunity of translating this book for North-},

abstract = {We present a general approach to quantum entanglement and entropy that is based on algebras of observables and states thereon. In contrast to more standard treatments, Hilbert space is an emergent concept, appearing as a representation space of the observable algebra, once a state is chosen. In this approach, which is based on the Gel'fand-Naimark-Segal construction, the study of subsystems becomes particularly clear. We explicitly show how the problems associated with the partial trace for the study of entanglement of identical particles are readily overcome. In particular, a suitable entanglement measure is proposed that can be applied to systems of particles obeying Fermi, Bose, para-, and even braid-group statistics. The generality of the method is also illustrated by study of the time evolution of subsystems emerging from restriction to subalgebras. Problems related to anomalies and quantum epistemology are also discussed. DOI:},

abstract = {Los aspectos esenciales de un difract{\'{o}}metro se muestran en la Figura 1.1. Una muestra cristalina s{\'{o}}lida o en polvo en polvo C, se monta sobre una mesa H, que puede girar alrededor de un eje O perpendicular al plano del dibujo. La fuente de rayos X es S y el blanco del tubo de rayos X es T. Los rayos X divergen desde la fuente y son difractados por la muestra para formar un haz difractado convergente que focaliza en la rendija F y luego ingresa al contador G. A y B son rendijas especiales que definen y coliman a los haces incidente y difractado. La rendija receptora F y el contador se soportan en un carril E que puede girar alrededor del eje O y cuya posici{\'{o}}n angular 2[ puede ser le{\'{i}}da sobre la escala graduada K. Los soportes E y H est{\'{a}}n acoplados mec{\'{a}}nicamente de tal forma que una rotaci{\'{o}}n del contador a trav{\'{e}}s de 2x grados es acompa{\~{n}}ada por la rotaci{\'{o}}n de la muestra a trav{\'{e}}s de x grados. Un motor produce el movimiento del contador a velocidad angular constante. 1.2. {\'{O}}PTICA DE LOS RAYOS X El funcionamiento de un difract{\'{o}}metro de rayos X, se basa en el Principio de focalizaci{\'{o}}n de BRAGG-BRENTANO. Este principio establece que para cualquier posici{\'{o}}n del sistema de detecci{\'{o}}n de rayos X, el diafragma receptor F del sistema de detecci{\'{o}}n y el diafragma de entrada S (o el foco del tubo de rayos X), est{\'{a}}n siempre localizados sobre un c{\'{i}}rculo denominado c{\'{i}}rculo difractom{\'{e}}trico. La muestra se monta de manera que pueda rotar y su superficie se ubica en el eje de rotaci{\'{o}}n de la muestra que es conc{\'{e}}ntrico al eje de rotaci{\'{o}}n del sistema detector. El haz primario divergente que incide sobre los planos difractantes de la red, bajo un {\'{a}}ngulo de Bragg $\theta$, es difractado bajo el mismo {\'{a}}ngulo, y debido al acoplamiento mec{\'{a}}nico del portamuestra con el sistema de detecci{\'{o}}n, los planos difractantes de la red siempre son tangentes a un c{\'{i}}rculo de focalizaci{\'{o}}n centrado sobre la normal a la muestra y que pasa a trav{\'{e}}s de F y S. El c{\'{i}}rculo de focalizaci{\'{o}}n no es de tama{\~{n}}o constante sino que incrementa su radio cuando el {\'{a}}ngulo de difracci{\'{o}}n 2$\theta$ disminuye, como se muestra en la Figura 1.2, para dos posibles reflexiones.

The third chapter establishes the existence and uniqueness of global fundamental solutions on globally hyperbolic spacetimes and discusses Green's operators and well-posedness of the Cauchy problem. The last chapter is devoted to field quantization in the sense of algebraic quantum field theory. The necessary basics on C*-algebras and CCR-representations are developed in full detail. The text provides a self-contained introduction to these topics addressed to graduate students in mathematics and physics.

abstract = {Scalar QFT on the boundary Latin small letter zhe sign+ at future null infinity of a general asymptotically flat 4D spacetime is constructed using the algebraic approach based on Weyl algebra associated to a BMS-invariant symplectic form. The constructed theory turns out to be invariant under a suitable strongly-continuous unitary representation of the BMS group with manifest meaning when the fields are interpreted as suitable extensions to Latin small letter zhe sign+ of massless minimally coupled fields propagating in the bulk. The group theoretical analysis of the found unitary BMS representation proves that such a field on Latin small letter zhe sign + coincides with the natural wave function constructed out of the unitary BMS irreducible representation induced from the little group $\Delta$, the semidirect product between SO(2) and the two-dimensional translations group. This wave function is massless with respect to the notion of mass for BMS representation theory. The presented result proposes a natural criterion to solve the long-standing problem of the topology of BMS group. Indeed the found natural correspondence of quantum field theories holds only if the BMS group is equipped with the nuclear topology rejecting instead the Hubert one. Eventually, some theorems towards a holographic description on Latin small letter zhe sign+ of QFT in the bulk are established at level of C*-algebras of fields for asymptotically flat at null infinity spacetimes. It is proved that preservation of a certain symplectic form implies the existence of an injective *-homomorphism from the Weyl algebra of fields of the bulk into that associated with the boundary Latin small letter zhe sign+. Those results are, in particular, applied to 4D Minkowski spacetime where a nice interplay between Poincar{\'{e}} invariance in the bulk and BMS invariance on the boundary at null infinity is established at the level of QFT. It arises that, in this case, the *-homomorphism admits unitary implementation and Minkowski vacuum is mapped into the BMS invariant vacuum on Latin small letter zhe sign+. {\textcopyright} World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract = {The mathematics of classical probability theory was subsumed into classical measure theory by Kolmogorov in 1933. Quantum theory as nonclassical probability theory was incorporated into the beginnings of noncommutative measure theory by von Neumann in the early 1930s, as well. To precisely this end, von Neumann initiated the study of what are now called von Neumann algebras and, with Murray, made a first classification of such algebras into three types. The nonrelativistic quantum theory of systems with finitely many degrees of freedom deals exclusively with type I algebras. However, for the description of further quantum systems, the other types of von Neumann algebras are indispensable. The paper reviews quantum probability theory in terms of general von Neumann algebras, stressing the similarity of the conceptual structure of classical and noncommutative probability theories and emphasizing the correspondence between the classical and quantum concepts, though also indicating the nonclassical nature of quantum probabilistic predictions. In addition, differences between the probability theories in the type I, II and III settings are explained. A brief description is given of quantum systems for which probability theory based on type I algebras is known to be insufficient. These illustrate the physical significance of the previously mentioned differences. {{\textcopyright}} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {One of von Neumann's motivations for developing the theory of operator algebras and his and Murray's 1936 classification of factors was the question of possible decompositions of quantum systems into independent parts. For quantum systems with a finite number of degrees of freedom the simplest possibility, i.e., factors of type I in the terminology of Murray and von Neumann, are perfectly adequate. In relativistic quantum field theory (RQFT), on the other hand, factors of type III occur naturally. The same holds true in quantum statistical mechanics of infinite systems. In this brief review some physical consequences of the type III property of the von Neumann algebras corresponding to localized observables in RQFT and their difference from the type I case will be discussed. The cumulative effort of many people over more than 30 years has established a remarkable uniqueness result: The local algebras in RQFT are generically isomorphic to the unique, hyperfinite type ${\rm III}_{1}$ factor in Connes' classification of 1973. Specific theories are characterized by the net structure of the collection of these isomorphic algebras for different space-time regions, i.e., the way they are embedded into each other.},

Volume 1, first published in 1998, provides a thorough introduction to the bosonic string. The first four chapters introduce the central ideas of string theory, the tools of conformal field theory and of the Polyakov path integral, and the covariant quantization of the string. The next three chapters treat string interactions: the general formalism, and detailed treatments of the tree level and one loop amplitudes. Chapter eight covers toroidal compactification and many important aspects of string physics, such as T-duality and D-branes. Chapter nine treats higher-order amplitudes, including an analysis of their finiteness and unitarity, and various nonperturbative ideas. An appendix giving a short course on path integral methods is included. This is an essential text and reference for graduate students and researchers interested in modern superstring theory.},

@article{Strocchi2013,
abstract = {Quantum Field Theory (QFT) has proved to be the most useful strategy for the description of elementary particle interactions and as such is regarded as a fundamental part of modern theoretical physics. In most presentations, the emphasis is on the effectiveness of the theory in producing experimentally testable predictions, which at present essentially means Perturbative QFT. However, after more than fifty years of QFT, we still are in the embarrassing situation of not knowing a single non-trivial (even non-realistic) model of QFT in 3+1 dimensions, allowing a non-perturbative control. As a reaction to these consistency problems one may take the position that they are related to our ignorance of the physics of small distances and that QFT is only an effective theory, so that radically new ideas are needed for a consistent quantum theory of relativistic interactions (in 3+1 dimensions).The book starts by discussing the conflict between locality or hyperbolicity and positivity of the energy for relativistic wave equations, which marks the origin of quantum field theory, and the mathematical problems of the perturbative expansion (canonical quantization, interaction picture, non-Fock representation, asymptotic convergence of the series etc.). The general physical principles of positivity of the energy, Poincare' covariance and locality provide a substitute for canonical quantization, qualify the non-perturbative foundation and lead to very relevant results, like the Spin-statistics theorem, TCP symmetry, a substitute for canonical quantization, non-canonical behaviour, the euclidean formulation at the basis of the functional integral approach, the non-perturbative definition of the S-matrix (LSZ, Haag-Ruelle-Buchholz theory).A characteristic feature of gauge field theories is Gauss' law constraint. It is responsible for the conflict between locality of the charged fields and positivity, it yields the superselection of the (unbroken) gauge charges, provides a non-perturbative explanation of the Higgs mechanism in the local gauges, implies the infraparticle structure of the charged particles in QED and the breaking of the Lorentz group in the charged sectors.A non-perturbative proof of the Higgs mechanism is discussed in the Coulomb gauge: the vector bosons corresponding to the broken generators are massive and their two point function dominates the Goldstone spectrum, thus excluding the occurrence of massless Goldstone bosons.The solution of the U(1) problem in QCD, the theta vacuum structure and the inevitable breaking of the chiral symmetry in each theta sector are derived solely from the topology of the gauge group, without relying on the semiclassical instanton approximation.},

In a similar way, possible Wess-Zumino interactions of such a group G are classified by H3(G, Z). The relation between three dimensional Chern-Simons gauge theory and two dimensional sigma models involves a certain natural map from H4(BG, Z) to H3(G, Z). We generalize this correspondence to topological "spin" theories, which are defined on three manifolds with spin structure, and are related to what might be called Z2 graded chiral algebras (or chiral superalgebras) in two dimensions. Finally we discuss in some detail the formulation of these topological gauge theories for the special case of a finite group, establishing links with two dimensional (holomorphic) orbifold models. {\textcopyright} 1990 Springer-Verlag.},

What is to follow, therefore, represents a combination of the methods of the formal calculus of variations with those of Lie's group theory. For special groups and problems in variation, this combination of methods is not new; I may cite Hamel and Herglotz for special finite groups, Lorentz and his pupils (for instance Fokker), Weyl and Klein for special infinite groups. Especially Klein's second Note and the present developments have been mutually influenced by each other, in which regard I may refer to the concluding remarks of Klein's Note.},

Several criteria have been proposed that have the drawback of being different according to whether one is dealing with fermions, bosons, or distinguishable particles. In this Letter, we give a precise and mathematically natural answer to this problem. Our approach is based on the use of the more general idea of the restriction of states to subalgebras. It leads to a novel approach to entanglement, which is suitable to be used in general quantum systems and especially in systems of identical particles. This settles some recent controversy regarding entanglement for identical particles. The prospects for applications of our criteria are wide ranging, from spin chains in condensed matter to entropy of black holes.},

By using a quantum jump approach, we demonstrate that in the presence of quantum coherent energy transfer and energetic disorder, the efficiency of excitation transfer from the antenna to the reaction center depends intimately on the quantum superposition properties of the initial state. In particular, we find that efficiency is sensitive to symmetric and asymmetric superposition of states in the basis of localized excitations, indicating that initial-state properties can be used as an efficiency control parameter at low temperatures.},

The presentation includes a review of Clifford algebras, spin groups and the spin representation, as well as a review of spin structures and spin [superscript C] structures. With this foundation established, the Dirac operator is defined and studied, with special attention to the cases of Hermitian manifolds and symmetric spaces. Then, certain analytic properties are established, including self-adjointness and the Fredholm property. An important link between the geometry and the analysis is provided by estimates for the eigenvalues of the Dirac operator in terms of the scalar curvature and the sectional curvature. Considerations of Killing spinors and solutions of the twistor equation on M lead to results about whether M is an Einstein manifold or conformally equivalent to one. Finally, in an appendix, Friedrich gives a concise introduction to the Seiberg-Witten invariants, which are a powerful tool for the study of four-manifolds. There is also an appendix reviewing principal bundles and connections.},

@article{Weingarten2016,
abstract = {Although quantum mechanics is fundamental for understanding molecular mechanisms in physics and chemistry, it has usually been assumed to be unimportant for understanding molecular mechanisms of biological systems. However, there is increasing evidence that quantum mechanics is important for understanding some biological phenomena (Lambert et al., 2013), such as energy transfer in photosynthesis (Fassioli et al., 2014), navigation by birds using the earth's magnetic field (Hiscock et al., 2016), and electron and hydrogen tunneling in biochemical reactions (Klinman and Kohen, 2013). There have also been proposals that quantum mechanics may help explain aspects of brain function. Discussions about quantum mechanics and the brain began with questions on the role of measurement or observation in quantum mechanics (Stapp, 1991; Theise and Kafatos, 2013). Further developments began to highlight the possibility that quantum mechanics might help explain neural mechanisms involved in consciousness or synaptic function (Stapp, 1991; Beck and Eccles, 1992). Another topic that emerged was whether quantum mechanisms might be employed by the brain to perform calculations, i.e., the possibility of quantum computing in the brain (Penrose, 1989). For example, a model of consciousness was developed that involves quantum computations in neuronal microtubules (Tegmark, 2000; Penrose and Hameroff, 2011; Hameroff and Penrose, 2014a,b; Reimers et al., 2014; Craddock et al., 2015). Other proposals have focused on the quantum phenomenon of spin (see below). Hu and Wu (2004) suggested that nuclear spins of hydrogen, nitrogen, and phosphorus in neuronal cellular components and electron spins of diffusible oxygen and nitric oxide in the brain might mediate consciousness. Electron spins in the brain have also been suggested as a potential target of transcranial magnetic stimulation therapies (Chervyakov et al., 2015). Other perspectives have led to application of quantum probability theory to human decision making (Wang et al., 2014; Kvam et al., 2015). Finally, the above mentioned navigation by birds may involve a quantum mechanical cryptochrome radical-pair (spin dynamic) mechanism in neuronal retinal ganglion cells that transmit information to the brain (Mouritsen et al., 2004; Hiscock et al., 2016). Recently a new model for how the brain may store and process quantum information has been proposed (Fisher, 2015). The model includes specific biochemical components that could be employed for quantum processing in glutamatergic neurotransmission. It has potential relevance for molecular mechanisms underlying normal neural function, such as glutamatergic dependent neurocognitive systems, as well as psychiatric treatments such as lithium.},

At the same time, physicists\nshould be open to bizarre or mindboggling new formalisms, which need\nnot be operationalizable or testable at the lime of their creation,\nbut which may successfully lead to novel fields of phenomenology\nand technology.},

abstract = {It is shown that 2 + 1 dimensional quantum Yang-Mills theory, with an action consisting purely of the Chern-Simons term, is exactly soluble and gives a natural framework for understanding the Jones polynomial of knot theory in three dimensional terms. In this version, the Jones polynomial can be generalized from S 3 to arbitrary three manifolds, giving invariants of three manifolds that are computable from a surgery presentation. These results shed a surprising new light on conformal field theory in 1 + 1 dimensions. In a lecture at the Hermann Weyl Symposium last year [1], Michael Atiyah proposed two problems for quantum field theorists. The first problem was to give a physical interpretation to Donaldson theory. The second problem was to find an intrinsically three dimensional definition of the Jones polynomial of knot theory. These two problems might roughly be described as follows. Donaldson theory is a key to understanding geometry in four dimensions. Four is the physical dimension at least macroscopically, so one may take a slight liberty and say that Donaldson theory is a key to understanding the geometry of space-time. Geometers have long known that (via de Rham theory) the self-dual and anti-self-dual Maxwell equations are related to natural topological invariants of a four manifold, namely the second homology group and its intersection form. For a simply connected four manifold, these are essentially the only classical invariants, but they leave many basic questions out of reach. Donaldson's great insight [2] was to realize that moduli spaces of solutions of the self-dual Yang-Mills equations can be powerful tools for addressing these questions.},

Free quantum field theory on the horizon enjoys diffeomorphism invariance and turns out to be unitarily and algebraically equivalent to the analogous theory of a scalar field propagating inside Rindler space-time, no matter the value of the mass of the field in the bulk. More precisely, there exists a unitary transformation that realizes the bulk-boundary correspondence upon an appropriate choice for Fock representation spaces. Second, the found correspondence is a subcase of an analogous algebraic correspondence described by injective *-homomorphisms of the abstract algebras of observables generated by abstract quantum free-field operators. These field operators are smeared with suitable test functions in the bulk and exact one-forms on the horizon. In this sense the correspondence is independent from the chosen vacua. It is proven that, under that correspondence, the "hidden" SL(2,ℝ) quantum symmetry found in a previous work gets a clear geometric meaning, it being associated with a group of diffeomorphisms of the horizon itself. {\textcopyright} 2004 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {The present work contains a complete formulation of the Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) formalism in the framework of locally covariant field theory. In the first part of the thesis the classical theory is investigated with a particular focus on the infinite dimensional character of the underlying structures. It is shown that the use of infinite dimensional differential geometry allows for a conceptually clear and elegant formulation. The construction of the BV complex is performed in a fully covariant way and we also generalize the BV framework to a more abstract level, using functors and natural transformations. In this setting we construct the BV complex for classical gravity. This allows us to give a homological interpretation to the notion of diffeomorphism invariant physical quantities in general relativity. The second part of the thesis concerns the quantum theory. We provide a framework for the BV quantization that doesn't rely on the path integral formalism, but is completely formulated within perturbative algebraic quantum field theory. To make such a formulation possible we first prove that the renormalized time-ordered product can be understood as a binary operation on a suitable domain. Using this result we prove the associativity of this product and provide a consistent framework for the renormalized BV structures. In particular the renormalized quantum master equation and the renormalized quantum BV operator are defined. To give a precise meaning to theses objects we make a use of the master Ward identity, which is an important structure in causal perturbation theory.},

abstract = {"Is entanglement monogamous?" asks the title of a popular article [B. Terhal, IBM J. Res. Dev. 48, 71 (2004)], celebrating C. H. Bennett's legacy on quantum information theory. While the answer is affirmative in the qualitative sense, the situation is less clear if monogamy is intended as a quantitative limitation on the distribution of bipartite entanglement in a multipartite system, given some particular measure of entanglement. Here, we formalize what it takes for a bipartite measure of entanglement to obey a general quantitative monogamy relation on all quantum states. We then prove that an important class of entanglement measures fail to be monogamous in this general sense of the term, with monogamy violations becoming generic with increasing dimension. In particular, we show that every additive and suitably normalized entanglement measure cannot satisfy any nontrivial general monogamy relation while at the same time faithfully capturing the geometric entanglement structure of the fully antisymmetric state in arbitrary dimension. Nevertheless, monogamy of such entanglement measures can be recovered if one allows for dimension-dependent relations, as we show explicitly with relevant examples.},

abstract = {It has been known for some years that entanglement entropy obtained from partial trace does not provide the correct entanglement measure when applied to systems of identical particles. Several criteria have been proposed that have the drawback of being different according to whether one is dealing with fermions, bosons, or distinguishable particles. In this Letter, we give a precise and mathematically natural answer to this problem. Our approach is based on the use of the more general idea of the restriction of states to subalgebras. It leads to a novel approach to entanglement, which is suitable to be used in general quantum systems and especially in systems of identical particles. This settles some recent controversy regarding entanglement for identical particles. The prospects for applications of our criteria are wide ranging, from spin chains in condensed matter to entropy of black holes.},

We demonstrate that the distillable entanglement is zero for pure Abelian gauge theories at zero gauge coupling, while it is in general nonzero for the non-Abelian case. We also consider gauge theories with matter, and show in a perturbative approach how area laws - including a topological correction - emerge for the distillable entanglement.

Firstly, in the algebraic quantum formalism, I show that the assumption of reversibility implies that the observables of a quantum theory form an abstract real C*-algebra, and can be represented as an algebra of operators on a real Hilbert space. Secondly, in the quantum logic formalism, I emphasize which axioms for the lattice of propositions (existence of an orthocomplementation and the covering property) derive from reversibility. A new argument based on locality and Soler's theorem is used to derive the representation as projectors on a regular Hilbert space from the general quantum logic formalism. In both cases it is recalled that the restriction to complex algebras and Hilbert spaces comes from the constraints of locality and separability.},

The definition takes a kinematical approach, with an initial state that is evolved cyclically but coupled to an environment--leading to a correction of the geometric phase with respect to the uncoupled case. We obtain this correction by measuring the nonunitary evolution of the reduced density matrix of a spin one-half coupled to an environment. In particular we are interested in baths near a quantum phase transition, which are known to induce strong decoherence.

Whether the indistinguishability due to particle identity is an exploitable quantum resource remains an open issue. Here we study independently prepared identical particles showing that, when they spatially overlap, an operational entanglement exists which can be made manifest by means of separated localized measurements. We prove this entanglement is physical in that it can be directly exploited to activate quantum information protocols, such as teleportation. These results establish that particle indistinguishability is a utilizable quantum feature and open the way to new quantum-enhanced applications.},

In contrast to more standard treatments, Hilbert space is an emergent concept, appearing as a representation space of the observable algebra, once a state is chosen. In this approach, which is based on the Gel'fand-Naimark-Segal construction, the study of subsystems becomes particularly clear. We explicitly show how the problems associated with the partial trace for the study of entanglement of identical particles are readily overcome. In particular, a suitable entanglement measure is proposed that can be applied to systems of particles obeying Fermi, Bose, para-, and even braid-group statistics. The generality of the method is also illustrated by study of the time evolution of subsystems emerging from restriction to subalgebras. Problems related to anomalies and quantum epistemology are also discussed. DOI:},

Our architecture requires only two Majoranas to encode a fermionic quantum degree of freedom, compared to alternative implementations which require a minimum of four Majoranas for a spin quantum degree of freedom. The fermionic degrees of freedom support both unitary coupled cluster variational quantum eigensolver and quantum phase estimation algorithms, proposed for quantum chemistry simulations. Because we avoid the Jordan-Wigner transformation, our scheme has a lower overhead for implementing both of these algorithms, and the simulation of Trotterized Hubbard Hamiltonian in $\mathcal{O}(1)$ time per unitary step. We finally demonstrate magic state distillation in our fermionic architecture, giving a universal set of topologically protected fermionic quantum gates.},

Instantaneous measurement of these observables is known to be a difficult problem, especially when the measurements are projective. The standard von Neumann Hamiltonian used to model projective measurements cannot be implemented directly in a non-local scenario and can, in some cases, violate causality. We present a scheme for effectively generating the von Neumann Hamiltonian for non-local observables without the need to communicate and adapt. The protocol can be used to perform weak and strong (projective) measurements, as well as measurements at any intermediate strength. It can also be used in practical situations beyond non-local measurements. We show how the protocol can be used to probe a version of Hardy's paradox with both weak and strong measurements. The outcomes of these measurements provide a non-intuitive picture of the pre- and post-selected system. Our results shed new light on the interplay between quantum measurements, uncertainty, non-locality, causality and determinism.},

These are in general different. Therefore one reaches the remarkable possibility that there may be many entropies for a given state [Private communication from R. Sorkin]. This ambiguity in entropy can often be traced to a gauge symmetry emergent from the non-trivial topological character of the configuration space of the underlying system. It can also happen in finite-dimensional matrix models. In the present work, we discuss this entropy ambiguity and its consequences for an ethylene molecule. This is a very simple and well-known system where these notions can be put to tests. Besides its intrinsic conceptual interest, the simplicity of this model can serve as an introduction to a similar discussion of systems such as coloured monopoles and the breaking of colour symmetry.},

@article{Borchers2000,
abstract = {In the book of Haag [Local Quantum Physics (Springer Verlag, Berlin, 1992)] about local quantum field theory the main results are obtained by the older methods of C * - and W * -algebra theory. A great advance, especially in the theory of W * -algebras, is due to Tomita's discovery of the theory of modular Hilbert algebras [Quasi-standard von Neumann algebras, Preprint (1967)]. Because of the abstract nature of the underlying concepts, this theory became (except for some sporadic results) a technique for quantum field theory only in the beginning of the nineties. In this review the results obtained up to this point will be collected and some problems for the future will be discussed at the end. In the first section the technical tools will be presented. Then in the second section two concepts, the half-sided translations and the half-sided modular inclusions, will be explained. These concepts have revolutionized the handling of quantum field theory. Examples for which the modular groups are explicitly known are presented in the third section. One of the important results of the new theory is the proof of the PCT theorem in the theory of local observables. Questions connected with the proof are discussed in Sec. IV. Section V deals with the structure of local algebras and with questions connected with symmetry groups. In Sec. VI a theory of tensor product decompositions will be presented. In the last section problems that are closely connected with the modular theory and that should be treated in the future will be discussed.},

@article{Balachandran2013a,
abstract = {It has been known for some years that entanglement entropy obtained from partial trace does not provide the correct entanglement measure when applied to systems of identical particles. Several criteria have been proposed that have the drawback of being different according to whether one is dealing with fermions, bosons, or distinguishable particles. In this Letter, we give a precise and mathematically natural answer to this problem. Our approach is based on the use of the more general idea of the restriction of states to subalgebras. It leads to a novel approach to entanglement, which is suitable to be used in general quantum systems and especially in systems of identical particles. This settles some recent controversy regarding entanglement for identical particles. The prospects for applications of our criteria are wide ranging, from spin chains in condensed matter to entropy of black holes.},

@article{Haag1964,
abstract = {It is shown that two quantum theories dealing, respectively, in the Hilbert spaces of state vectors H1 and H2 are physically equivalent whenever we have a faithful representation of the same abstract algebra of observables in both spaces, no matter whether the representations are unitarily equivalent or not. This allows a purely algebraic formulation of the theory. The framework of an algebraic version of quantum field theory is discussed and compared to the customary operator approach. It is pointed out that one reason (and possibly the only one) for the existence of unitarily inequivalent faithful, irreducible representations in quantum field theory is the (physically irrelevant) behavior of the states with respect to observations made infinitely far away. The separation between such ``global&apos;&apos; features and the local ones is studied. An application of this point of view to superselection rules shows that, for example, in electrodynamics the Hilbert space of states with charge zero carries already all the relevant physical information.},

abstract = {Simulating quantum mechanics is known to be a difficult computational problem, especially when dealing with large systems. However, this difficulty may be overcome by using some controllable quantum system to study another less controllable or accessible quantum system, i.e., quantum simulation. Quantum simulation promises to have applications in the study of many problems in, e.g., condensed-matter physics, high-energy physics, atomic physics, quantum chemistry and cosmology. Quantum simulation could be implemented using quantum computers, but also with simpler, analog devices that would require less control, and therefore, would be easier to con- struct. A number of quantum systems such as neutral atoms, ions, polar molecules, electrons in semiconductors, superconducting circuits, nuclear spins and photons have been proposed as quan- tum simulators. This review outlines the main theoretical and experimental aspects of quantum simulation and emphasizes some of the challenges and promises of this fast-growing field. APS/123-QED PACS},

abstract = {We present a general approach to quantum entanglement and entropy that is based on algebras of observables and states thereon. In contrast to more standard treatments, Hilbert space is an emergent concept, appearing as a representation space of the observable algebra, once a state is chosen. In this approach, which is based on the Gel'fand-Naimark-Segal construction, the study of subsystems becomes particularly clear. We explicitly show how the problems associated with the partial trace for the study of entanglement of identical particles are readily overcome. In particular, a suitable entanglement measure is proposed that can be applied to systems of particles obeying Fermi, Bose, para-, and even braid-group statistics. The generality of the method is also illustrated by study of the time evolution of subsystems emerging from restriction to subalgebras. Problems related to anomalies and quantum epistemology are also discussed. DOI:},

A gauge group of the first kind is shown to be automatically compact if the scattering states are complete and the mass and spin multiplets have finite multiplicity. Under reasonable assumptions about the structure of F it is shown that the inequivalent irreducible representations of A ("sectors") which occur are in one-to-one correspondence with the inequivalent irreducible representations of G and that all of them are "strongly locally equivalent". An irreducible representation of A satisfies the duality property only if the sector corresponds to a 1-dimensional representation of G. If G is Abelian the sectors are connected to each other by localized automorphisms.},

The capability of controlling our channel allows us to visualize its effects in a quantum system. Differently from standard dephasing channels, our channel presents an exotic behavior in the sense that the evolution of a state, from a pure to a mixed state, shows an oscillatory behavior if tracked in the Bloch sphere. Additionally, we report the evolution of the purity and perform a quantum process tomography to obtain the \chi matrix associated to our channel.},
